<h3>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>Plutarch, who was born at Ch&aelig;ronea in B&oelig;otia,
probably about A.D. 50, and was a contemporary of Tacitus and
Pliny, has written two works still extant, the well-known
<i>Lives</i>, and the less-known <i>Moralia</i>. The <i>Lives</i>
have often been translated, and have always been a popular work.
Great indeed was their power at the period of the French
Revolution. The <i>Moralia</i>, on the other hand, consisting of
various Essays on various subjects (only twenty-six of which are
directly ethical, though they have given their name to the
<i>Moralia</i>), are declared by Mr. Paley "to be practically
almost unknown to most persons in Britain, even to those who call
themselves scholars."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id=
"FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
<i>Habent etiam sua fata libelli.</i></p>

<p>In older days the <i>Moralia</i> were more valued. Montaigne,
who was a great lover of Plutarch, and who observes in one passage
of his Essays that "Plutarch and Seneca were the only two books of
solid learning he seriously settled himself to read," quotes as
much from the <i>Moralia</i> as from the <i>Lives</i>. And in the
seventeenth century I cannot but think the <i>Moralia</i> were
largely read at our Universities, at least at the University of
Cambridge. For, not to mention the wonderful way in which the
famous Jeremy Taylor has taken the cream of "Conjugal Precepts" in
his Sermon called "The Marriage Ring," or the large and copious use
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id=
"Page_viii">viii</a></span>he has made in his "Holy Living" of
three other Essays in this volume, namely, those "On Curiosity,"
"On Restraining Anger," and "On Contentedness of Mind," proving
conclusively what a storehouse he found the <i>Moralia</i>, we have
evidence that that most delightful poet, Robert Herrick, read the
<i>Moralia</i>, too, when at Cambridge, so that one cannot but
think it was a work read in the University course generally in
those days. For in a letter to his uncle written from Cambridge,
asking for books or money for books, he makes the following remark:
"How kind Arcisilaus the philosopher was unto Apelles the painter,
Plutark in his Morals will tell you."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id=
"FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class=
"fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>In 1882 the Reverend C. W. King, Senior Fellow of Trinity
College, Cambridge, translated the six "Theosophical Essays" of the
<i>Moralia</i>, forming a volume in Bohn's Classical Library. The
present volume consists of the twenty-six "Ethical Essays," which
are, in my opinion, the cream of the <i>Moralia</i>, and constitute
a highly interesting series of treatises on what might be called
"The Ethics of the Hearth and Home." I have grouped these Essays in
such a manner as to enable the reader to read together such as
touch on the same or on kindred subjects.</p>

<p>As is well known, the text of the <i>Moralia</i> is very
corrupt, and the reading very doubtful, in many places. In eight of
the twenty-six Essays in this volume I have had the invaluable help
of the text of Rudolf Hercher; help so invaluable that one cannot
but sadly regret that only one volume of the <i>Moralia</i> has yet
appeared in the <i>Bibliotheca Teubneriana</i>. Wyttenbach's text
and notes I have always used when available, and when not so have
fallen back upon Reiske. Reiske is always ingenious, but too fond
of correcting a text, and the criticism of him by Wyttenbach <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">ix</a></span>is
perhaps substantially correct. "In nullo auctore habitabat;
vagabatur per omnes: nec apud quemquam tamdiu divertebat, ut in
paulo interiorem ejus consuetudinem se insinuaret." I have also had
constantly before me the Didot Edition of the <i>Moralia</i>,
edited by Frederic D&uuml;bner.</p>

<p>Let any reader who wishes to know more about Plutarch, consult
the article on Plutarch, in the Ninth Edition of the
<i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, by the well-known scholar F. A.
Paley. He will also do well to read an Essay on Plutarch by R. W.
Emerson, reprinted in Volume III. of the Bohn's Standard Library
Edition of Emerson's Works, and Five Lectures on Plutarch by the
late Archbishop Trench, published by Messrs. Macmillan and Co. in
1874. All these contain much of interest, and will repay
perusal.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I hope this little volume will be the means of
making popular some of the best thoughts of one of the most
interesting and thoughtful of the ancients, who often seems indeed
almost a modern.</p>

<h3>PLUTARCH'S MORALS.</h3>

<h4>ON EDUCATION.</h4>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Come let us consider what
one might say on the education of free children, and by what
training they would become good citizens.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> It is perhaps best to
begin with birth: I would therefore warn those who desire to be
fathers of notable sons, not to form connections with any kind of
women, such as courtesans or mistresses: for those who either on
the father or mother's side are ill-born have the disgrace of their
origin all their life long irretrievably present with them, and
offer a ready handle to abuse and vituperation. So that the poet
was wise, who said, "Unless the foundation of a house be well laid,
the descendants must of necessity be unfortunate."<a name=
"FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class=
"fnanchor">3</a> Good birth indeed brings with it a store of
assurance, which ought to be greatly valued by all who desire
legitimate offspring. For the spirit of those who are a spurious
and bastard breed is apt to be mean and abject: for as the poet
truly says, "It makes a man even of noble spirit servile, when he
is conscious of the ill fame of either his father or mother."<a
name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4"
class="fnanchor">4</a> On the other hand the sons of illustrious
parents are full of pride and arrogance. As an instance of this it
is recorded of Diophantus,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id=
"FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
the son of Themistocles, that he often used to say to various
people "that he could do what he pleased with the Athenian people,
for what he wished his mother wished, and what she wished
Themistocles wished, and what Themistocles <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>wished all the Athenians
wished." All praise also ought we to bestow on the
Laced&aelig;monians for their loftiness of soul in fining their
king Archidamus for venturing to marry a small woman, for they
charged him with intending to furnish them not with kings but
kinglets.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> Next must we mention,
what was not overlooked even by those who handled this subject
before us, that those who approach their wives for procreation must
do so either without having drunk any wine or at least very little.
For those children, that their parents begot in drink, are wont to
be fond of wine and apt to turn out drunkards. And so Diogenes,
seeing a youth out of his mind and crazy, said, "Young man, your
father was drunk when he begot you." Let this hint serve as to
procreation: now let us discuss education.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> To speak generally, what
we are wont to say about the arts and sciences is also true of
moral excellence, for to its perfect development three things must
meet together, natural ability, theory, and practice. By theory I
mean training, and by practice working at one's craft. Now the
foundation must be laid in training, and practice gives facility,
but perfection is attained only by the junction of all three. For
if any one of these elements be wanting, excellence must be so far
deficient. For natural ability without training is blind: and
training without natural ability is defective, and practice without
both natural ability and training is imperfect. For just as in
farming the first requisite is good soil, next a good farmer, next
good seed, so also here: the soil corresponds to natural ability,
the training to the farmer, the seed to precepts and instruction. I
should therefore maintain stoutly that these three elements were
found combined in the souls of such universally famous men as
Pythagoras, and Socrates, and Plato, and of all who have won
undying fame. Happy at any rate and dear to the gods is he to whom
any deity has vouchsafed all these elements! But if anyone thinks
that those who have not good natural ability cannot to some extent
make up for the deficiencies of nature by right training and
practice, let such a one know that he is very wide of the mark, if
not out of it altogether. For good natural parts are impaired by
sloth; while inferior ability is<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span> mended by training: and while
simple things escape the eyes of the careless, difficult things are
reached by painstaking. The wonderful efficacy and power of long
and continuous labour you may see indeed every day in the world
around you.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> Thus water continually
dropping wears away rocks: and iron and steel are moulded by the
hands of the artificer: and chariot wheels bent by some strain can
never recover their original symmetry: and the crooked staves of
actors can never be made straight. But by toil what is contrary to
nature becomes stronger than even nature itself. And are these the
only things that teach the power of diligence? Not so: ten thousand
things teach the same truth. A soil naturally good becomes by
neglect barren, and the better its original condition, the worse
its ultimate state if uncared for. On the other hand a soil
exceedingly rough and sterile by being farmed well produces
excellent crops. And what trees do not by neglect become gnarled
and unfruitful, whereas by pruning they become fruitful and
productive? And what constitution so good but it is marred and
impaired by sloth, luxury, and too full habit? And what weak
constitution has not derived benefit from exercise and athletics?
And what horses broken in young are not docile to their riders?
while if they are not broken in till late they become hard-mouthed
and unmanageable. And why should we be surprised at similar cases,
seeing that we find many of the savagest animals docile and tame by
training? Rightly answered the Thessalian, who was asked who the
mildest Thessalians were, "Those who have done with fighting."<a
name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7"
class="fnanchor">7</a> But why pursue the line of argument further?
For the Greek name for moral virtue is only habit: and if anyone
defines moral virtues as habitual virtues, he will not be beside
the mark. But I will employ only one more illustration, and dwell
no longer on this topic. Lycurgus, the Laced&aelig;monian
legislator, took two puppies of the same parents, and brought them
up in an entirely different way: the one he pampered and cosseted
up, while he taught the other to hunt and be a retriever. Then on
one occasion, when the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id=
"Page_4">4</a></span>Laced&aelig;monians were convened in assembly,
he said, "Mighty, O Laced&aelig;monians, is the influence on moral
excellence of habit, and education, and training, and modes of
life, as I will prove to you at once." So saying he produced the
two puppies, and set before them a platter and a hare: the one
darted on the hare, while the other made for the platter. And when
the Laced&aelig;monians could not guess what his meaning was, or
with what intent he had produced the puppies, he said, "These
puppies are of the same parents, but by virtue of a different
bringing up the one is pampered, and the other a good hound." Let
so much suffice for habit and modes of life.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> The next point to discuss
will be nutrition. In my opinion mothers ought to nurse and suckle
their own children. For they will bring them up with more sympathy
and care, if they love them so intimately and, as the proverb puts
it, "from their first growing their nails."<a name="FNanchor_8_8"
id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class=
"fnanchor">8</a> Whereas the affection of wet or dry nurses is
spurious and counterfeit, being merely for pay. And nature itself
teaches that mothers ought themselves to suckle and rear those they
have given birth to. And for that purpose she has supplied every
female parent with milk. And providence has wisely provided women
with two breasts, so that if they should bear twins, they would
have a breast for each. And besides this, as is natural enough,
they would feel more affection and love for their children by
suckling them. For this supplying them with food is as it were a
tightener of love, for even the brute creation, if taken away from
their young, pine away, as we constantly see. Mothers must
therefore, as I said, certainly try to suckle their own children:
but if they are unable to do so either through physical weakness
(for this contingency sometimes occurs), or in haste to have other
children, they must select wet and dry nurses with the greatest
care, and not introduce into their houses any kind of women. First
and foremost they must be Greeks in their habits. For just as it is
necessary immediately after birth to shapen the limbs of children,
so that they may grow straight and not crooked, so from the
beginning must their habits be carefully <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>attended to. For infancy is
supple and easily moulded, and what children learn sinks deeply
into their souls while they are young and tender, whereas
everything hard is softened only with great difficulty. For just as
seals are impressed on soft wax, so instruction leaves its
permanent mark on the minds of those still young. And divine Plato
seems to me to give excellent advice to nurses not to tell their
children any kind of fables, that their souls may not in the very
dawn of existence be full of folly or corruption.<a name=
"FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class=
"fnanchor">9</a> Phocylides the poet also seems to give admirable
advice when he says, "We must teach good habits while the pupil is
still a boy."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> Attention also must he
given to this point, that the lads that are to wait upon and be
with young people must be first and foremost of good morals, and
able to speak Greek distinctly and idiomatically, that they may not
by contact with foreigners of loose morals contract any of their
viciousness. For as those who are fond of quoting proverbs say not
amiss, "If you live with a lame man, you will learn to halt."<a

"#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> Next, when our boys are
old enough to be put into the hands of tutors,<a name=
"FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11"
class="fnanchor">11</a> great care must be taken that we do not
hand them over to slaves, or foreigners, or flighty persons. For
what happens nowadays in many cases is highly ridiculous: good
slaves are made farmers, or sailors, or merchants, or stewards, or
money-lenders; but if they find a winebibbing, greedy, and utterly
useless slave, to him parents commit the charge of their sons,
whereas the good tutor ought to be such a one as was Ph&oelig;nix,
the tutor of Achilles. The point also which I am now going to speak
about is of the utmost importance. The schoolmasters we ought to
select for our boys should be of blameless life, of pure character,
and of great experience. For a good training is the source and root
of gentlemanly behaviour. And just as farmers prop up their trees,
so good schoolmasters prop up the young by good advice and
suggestions, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id=
"Page_6">6</a></span>that they may become upright. How one must
despise, therefore, some fathers, who, whether from ignorance or
inexperience, before putting the intended teachers to the test,
commit their sons to the charge of untried and untested men. If
they act so through inexperience it is not so ridiculous; but it is
to the remotest degree absurd when, though perfectly aware of both
the inexperience and worthlessness of some schoolmasters, they yet
entrust their sons to them; some overcome by flattery, others to
gratify friends who solicit their favours; acting just as if
anybody ill in body, passing over the experienced physician,
should, to gratify his friend, call him in, and so throw away his
life; or as if to gratify one's friend one should reject the best
pilot and choose him instead. Zeus and all the gods! can anyone
bearing the sacred name of father put obliging a petitioner before
obtaining the best education for his sons? Were they not then wise
words that the time-honoured Socrates used to utter, and say that
he would proclaim, if he could, climbing up to the highest part of
the city, "Men, what can you be thinking of, who move heaven and
earth to make money, while you bestow next to no attention on the
sons you are going to leave that money to?"<a name="FNanchor_12_12"
id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class=
"fnanchor">12</a> I would add to this that such fathers act very
similarly to a person who should be very careful about his shoe but
care nothing about his foot. Many persons also are so niggardly
about their children, and indifferent to their interests, that for
the sake of a paltry saving, they prefer worthless teachers for
their children, practising a vile economy at the expense of their
children's ignorance. <i>Apropos</i> of this, Aristippus on one
occasion rebuked an empty-headed parent neatly and wittily. For
being asked how much money a parent ought to pay for his son's
education, he answered, "A thousand drachm&aelig;." And he
replying, "Hercules, what a price! I could buy a slave for as
much;" Aristippus answered, "You shall have two slaves then, your
son and the slave you buy."<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id=
"FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class=
"fnanchor">13</a> And is it not altogether strange that you
accustom your son to take his food in his right hand, and chide him
if he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id=
"Page_7">7</a></span>offers his left, whereas you care very little
about his hearing good and sound discourses? I will tell you what
happens to such admirable fathers, when they have educated and
brought up their sons so badly: when the sons grow to man's estate,
they disregard a sober and well-ordered life, and rush headlong
into disorderly and low vices; then at the last the parents are
sorry they have neglected their education, bemoaning bitterly when
it is too late their sons' debasement. For some of them keep
flatterers and parasites in their retinue&mdash;an accursed set of
wretches, the defilers and pest of youth; others keep mistresses
and common prostitutes, wanton and costly; others waste their money
in eating; others come to grief through dice and revelling; some
even go in for bolder profligacy, being whoremongers and defilers
of the marriage bed,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id=
"FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class=
"fnanchor">14</a> who would madly pursue their darling vice if it
cost them their lives. Had they associated with some philosopher,
they would not have lowered themselves by such practices, but would
have remembered the precept of Diogenes, whose advice sounds rather
low, but is really of excellent moral intent,<a name=
"FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15"
class="fnanchor">15</a> "Go into a brothel, my lad, that you may
see the little difference between vice and virtue."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> I say, then, to speak
comprehensively (and I might be justly considered in so saying to
speak as an oracle, not to be delivering a mere precept), that a
good education and sound bringing-up is of the first and middle and
last importance; and I declare it to be most instrumental and
conducive to virtue and happiness. For all other human blessings
compared to this are petty and insignificant. For noble birth is a
great honour, but it is an advantage from our forefathers. And
wealth is valuable, but it is the acquisition of fortune, who has
often taken it away from those who had it, and brought it to those
who little expected it; and much wealth is a sort of mark for
villanous slaves and informers to shoot at to fill their own <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>purses;
and, what is a most important point, even the greatest villains
have money sometimes. And glory is noble, but insecure. And beauty
is highly desirable, but shortlived. And health is highly valuable,
but soon impaired. And strength is desirable, but illness or age
soon made sad inroads into it. And generally speaking, if anyone
prides himself on his bodily strength, let him know that he is
deficient in judgment. For how much inferior is the strength of a
man to that of animals, as elephants, bulls, and lions! But
education is of all our advantages the only one immortal and
divine. And two of the most powerful agencies in man's nature are
mind and reason. And mind governs reason, and reason obeys mind;
and mind is irremovable by fortune, cannot be taken away by
informers, cannot be destroyed by disease, cannot have inroads made
into it by old age. For the mind alone flourishes in age; and while
time takes away everything else, it adds wisdom to old age. Even
war, that sweeps away everything else like a winter torrent, cannot
take away education. And Stilpo, the Megarian, seems to me to have
made a memorable answer when Demetrius enslaved Megara and rased it
to the ground. On his asking whether Stilpo had lost anything, he
replied, "Certainly not, for war can make no havoc of virtue."
Corresponding and consonant to this is the answer of Socrates, who
when asked, I think by Gorgias,<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id=
"FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class=
"fnanchor">16</a> if he had any conception as to the happiness of
the King of Persia, replied, "I do not know his position in regard
to virtue and education: for happiness lies in these, and not in
adventitious advantages."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> And as I advise parents to
think nothing more important than the education of their children,
so I maintain that it must be a sound and healthy education, and
that our sons must be kept as far as possible from vulgar twaddle.
For what pleases the vulgar displeases the wise. I am borne out by
the lines of Euripides, "Unskilled am I in the oratory that pleases
the mob; but amongst the few that are my equals I am reckoned
rather wise. For those who are little thought of by the wise, seem
to hit the taste <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id=
"Page_9">9</a></span>of the vulgar."<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id=
"FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class=
"fnanchor">17</a> And I have myself noticed that those who practise
to speak acceptably and to the gratification of the masses
promiscuously, for the most part become also profligate and lovers
of pleasure in their lives. Naturally enough. For if in giving
pleasure to others they neglect the noble, they would be hardly
likely to put the lofty and sound above a life of luxury and
pleasure, and to prefer moderation to delights. Yet what better
advice could we give our sons than to follow this? or to what could
we better exhort them to accustom themselves? For perfection is
only attained by neither speaking nor acting at random&mdash;as the
proverb says, <i>Perfection is only attained by practice</i>.<a
name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Whereas extempore oratory
is easy and facile, mere windbag, having neither beginning nor end.
And besides their other shortcomings extempore speakers fall into
great disproportion and repetition, whereas a well considered
speech preserves its due proportions. It is recorded by tradition
that Pericles, when called on by the people for a speech,
frequently refused on the plea that he was unprepared. Similarly
Demosthenes, his state-rival, when the Athenians called upon him
for his advice, refused to give it, saying, "I am not prepared."
But this you will say, perhaps, is mere tradition without
authority. But in his speech against Midias he plainly sets forth
the utility of preparation, for he says, "I do not deny, men of
Athens, that I have prepared this speech to the best of my ability:
for I should have been a poor creature if, after suffering so much
at his hands, and even still suffering, I had neglected how to
plead my case."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a
href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Not that I would
altogether reject extempore oratory, or its use in critical cases,
but it should be used only as one would take medicine.<a name=
"FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20"
class="fnanchor">20</a> Up, indeed, to man's estate I would have no
extempore speaking, but when anyone's powers of speech are rooted
and grounded, then, as emergencies call for it, I would allow his
words to flow freely. For as those who have been for a long time in
fetters stumble if unloosed, not being able <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>to walk from
being long used to their fetters, so those who for a long time have
used compression in their words, if they are suddenly called upon
to speak off-hand, retain the same character of expression. But to
let mere lads speak extempore is to give rise to the acme of
foolish talk. A wretched painter once showed Apelles, they say, a
picture, and said, "I have just done it." Apelles replied, "Without
your telling me, I should know it was painted quickly; I only
wonder you haven't painted more such in the time." As then (for I
now return from my digression), I advise to avoid stilted and
bombastic language, so again do I urge to avoid a finical and petty
style of speech; for tall talk is unpopular, and petty language
makes no impression. And as the body ought to be not only sound but
in good condition, so speech ought to be not only not feeble but
vigorous. For a safe mediocrity is indeed praised, but a bold
venturesomeness is also admired. I am also of the same opinion with
regard to the disposition of the soul, which ought to be neither
audacious nor timid and easily dejected: for the one ends in
impudence and the other in servility; but to keep in all things the
mean between extremes is artistic and proper. And, while I am still
on this topic, I wish to give my opinion, that I regard a
monotonous speech first as no small proof of want of taste, next as
likely to generate disdain, and certain not to please long. For to
harp on one string is always tiresome and brings satiety; whereas
variety is pleasant always whether to the ear or eye.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> Next our freeborn lad ought
to go in for a course of what is called general knowledge, but a
smattering of this will be sufficient, a taste as it were (for
perfect knowledge of all subjects would be impossible); but he must
seriously cultivate philosophy. I borrow an illustration to show my
meaning: it is well to sail round many cities, but advantageous to
live in the best. It was a witty remark of the philosopher Bion,<a
name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> that, as those suitors
who could not seduce Penelope took up with her maids as a <i>pis
aller</i>, so those who cannot attain philosophy wear themselves
out in useless pursuits. Philosophy, therefore, ought <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>to be
regarded as the most important branch of study. For as regards the
cure of the body, men have found two branches, medicine and
exercise: the former of which gives health, and the latter good
condition of body; but philosophy is the only cure for the maladies
and disorders of the soul. For with her as ruler and guide we can
know what is honourable, what is disgraceful; what is just, what
unjust; generally speaking, what is to be sought after, what to be
avoided; how we ought to behave to the gods, to parents, to elders,
to the laws, to foreigners, to rulers, to friends, to women, to
children, to slaves: viz., that we ought to worship the gods,
honour parents, reverence elders, obey the laws, submit ourselves
to rulers, love our friends, be chaste in our relations with women,
kind to our children, and not to treat our slaves badly; and, what
is of the greatest importance, to be neither over elated in
prosperity nor over depressed in adversity,<a name="FNanchor_22_22"
id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class=
"fnanchor">22</a> nor to be dissolute in pleasures, nor fierce and
brutish in anger. These I regard as the principal blessings that
philosophy teaches. For to enjoy prosperity nobly shows a man; and
to enjoy it without exciting envy shows a moderate man; and to
conquer the passions by reason argues a wise man; and it is not
everybody who can keep his temper in control. And those who can
unite political ability with philosophy I regard as perfect men,
for I take them to attain two of the greatest blessings, serving
the state in a public capacity, and living the calm and tranquil
life of philosophy. For, as there are three kinds of life, the
practical, the contemplative, and the life of enjoyment, and of
these three the one devoted to enjoyment is a paltry and animal
life, and the practical without philosophy an unlovely and harsh
life, and the contemplative without the practical a useless life,
so we must endeavour with all our power to combine public life with
philosophy as far as circumstances will permit. Such was the life
led by Pericles, by Archytas of Tarentum, by Dion of Syracuse, by
Epaminondas the Theban, one of whom was a disciple of Plato (viz.,
Dion). And as to education, I do not know that I need dwell any
more on it. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id=
"Page_12">12</a></span>But in addition to what I have said, it is
useful, if not necessary, not to neglect to procure old books, and
to make a collection of them, as is usual in agriculture. For the
use of books is an instrument in education, and it is profitable in
learning to go to the fountain head.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xi.</span> Exercise also ought not to
be neglected, but we ought to send our boys to the master of the
gymnasium to train them duly, partly with a view to carrying the
body well, partly with a view to strength. For good habit of body
in boys is the foundation of a good old age. For as in fine weather
we ought to lay up for winter, so in youth one ought to form good
habits and live soberly so as to have a reserve stock of strength
for old age. Yet ought we to husband the exertions of the body, so
as not to be wearied out by them and rendered unfit for study. For,
as Plato says,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a
href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> excessive sleep and
fatigue are enemies to learning. But why dwell on this? For I am in
a hurry to pass to the most important point. Our lads must be
trained for warlike encounters, making themselves efficient in
hurling the javelin and darts, and in the chase. For the
possessions of those who are defeated in battle belong to the
conquerors as booty of war; and war is not the place for delicately
brought up bodies: it is the spare warrior that makes the best
combatant, who as an athlete cuts his way through the ranks of the
enemies. Supposing anyone objects: "How so? As you undertook to
give advice on the education of freeborn children, do you now
neglect the poor and plebeian ones, and give instructions only
suitable to the rich?" It is easy enough to meet such critics. I
should prefer to make my teaching general and suitable to all; but
if any, through their poverty, shall be unable to follow up my
precepts, let them blame fortune, and not the author of these
hints. We must try with all our might to procure the best education
for the poor as well as the rich, but if that is impossible, then
we must put up with the practicable. I inserted those matters into
my discourse here, that I might hereafter confine myself to all
that appertains to the right education of the young.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xii.</span> And this I say that we
ought to try to draw our boys to good pursuits by entreaties and
exhortation, but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id=
"Page_13">13</a></span>certainly not by blows or abusive language.
For that seems to be more fitting for slaves than the freeborn. For
slaves try to shirk and avoid their work, partly because of the
pain of blows, partly on account of being reviled. But praise or
censure are far more useful than abuse to the freeborn, praise
pricking them on to virtue, censure deterring them from vice. But
one must censure and praise alternately: when they are too saucy we
must censure them and make them ashamed of themselves, and again
encourage them by praise, and imitate those nurses who, when their
children sob, give them the breast to comfort them. But we must not
puff them up and make them conceited with excessive praise, for
that will make them vain and give themselves airs.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> And I have ere now seen
some fathers, whose excessive love for their children has turned
into hatred. My meaning I will endeavour to make clearer by
illustration. While they are in too great a hurry to make their
sons take the lead in everything, they lay too much work upon them,
so that they faint under their tasks, and, being overburdened, are
disinclined for learning. For just as plants grow with moderate
rain, but are done for by too much rain, so the mind enlarges by a
proper amount of work, but by too much is unhinged. We must
therefore give our boys remission from continuous labour, bearing
in mind that all our life is divided into labour and rest; thus we
find not only wakefulness but sleep, not only war but peace, not
only foul weather but fine also, not only working days but also
festivals. And, to speak concisely, rest is the sauce of labour.
And we can see this not only in the case of animate, but even
inanimate things, for we make bows and lyres slack that we may be
able to stretch them. And generally the body is preserved by
repletion and evacuation, and the soul by rest and work. We ought
also to censure some fathers who, after entrusting their sons to
tutors and preceptors, neither see nor hear how the teaching is
done. This is a great mistake. For they ought after a few days to
test the progress of their sons, and not to base their hopes on the
behaviour of a hireling; and the preceptors will take all the more
pains with the boys, if they have from time to time to give an
account of their progress. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14"
id="Page_14">14</a></span> Hence the propriety of that remark of
the groom, that nothing fats the horse so much as the king's eye.<a
name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> And especial attention,
in my opinion, must be paid to cultivating and exercising the
memory of boys, for memory is, as it were, the storehouse of
learning; and that was why they fabled Mnemosyne to be the mother
of the Muses, hinting and insinuating that nothing so generates and
contributes to the growth of learning as memory. And therefore the
memory must be cultivated, whether boys have a good one by nature,
or a bad one. For we shall so add to natural good parts, and make
up somewhat for natural deficiencies, so that the deficient will be
better than others, and the clever will outstrip themselves. For
good is that remark of Hesiod, "If to a little you keep adding a
little, and do so frequently, it will soon be a lot."<a name=
"FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25"
class="fnanchor">25</a> And let not fathers forget, that thus
cultivating the memory is not only good for education, but is also
a great aid in the business of life. For the remembrance of past
actions gives a good model how to deal wisely in future ones.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> We must also keep our
sons from filthy language. For, as Democritus says, Language is the
shadow of action. They must also be taught to be affable and
courteous. For as want of affability is justly hateful, so boys
will not be disagreeable to those they associate with, if they
yield occasionally in disputes. For it is not only excellent to
know how to conquer, but also to know how to be defeated, when
victory would be injurious, for there is such a thing as a Cadmean
victory.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> I can cite wise Euripides
as a witness of the truth of what I say, who says, "When two are
talking, and one of them is in a passion, he is the wiser who first
gives way."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a
href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>I will next state something quite as important, indeed, if
anything, even more important. That is, that life must be spent
without luxury, the tongue must be <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>under control, so must the
temper and the hands. All this is of extreme importance, as I will
show by examples. To begin with the last case, some who have put
their hands to unjust gains, have lost all the fruits of their
former life, as the Laced&aelig;monian Gylippus,<a name=
"FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28"
class="fnanchor">28</a> who was exiled from Sparta for embezzling
the public money. To be able to govern the temper also argues a
wise man. For Socrates, when a very impudent and disgusting young
fellow kicked him on one occasion, seeing all the rest of his class
vexed and impatient, even to the point of wanting to prosecute the
young man, said, "What! If a young ass kicked me would you have me
kick it back?" Not that the young fellow committed this outrage on
Socrates with impunity, for as all reviled him and nicknamed him
the kicker, he hung himself. And when Aristophanes brought his
"<i>Clouds</i>" on the stage, and bespattered Socrates with his
gibes and flouts, and one of the spectators said, "Aren't you
vexed, Socrates, at his exhibiting you on the stage in this comic
light?" he answered, "Not I, by Zeus, for I look upon the theatre
as only a large supper party."<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id=
"FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class=
"fnanchor">29</a> Very similar to this was the behaviour of
Archytas of Tarentum and Plato. The former, on his return from war,
where he had been general, finding his land neglected, called his
bailiff, and said to him, "You would have caught it, had I not been
very angry." And Plato, very angry with a gluttonous and shameless
slave, called his sister's son Speusippus, and said, "Go and beat
him, for I am too angry." But someone will say, these examples are
difficult and hard to follow. I know it. But we must try, as far as
possible, following these examples, to avoid ungovernable and mad
rage. For we cannot in other respects equal those distinguished men
in their ability and virtue, nevertheless we must, like initiating
priests of the gods and torchbearers of wisdom, attempt as far as
possible to imitate and nibble at their practice. Then, again, if
anyone thinks it a small and unimportant matter to govern the
tongue, another point I promised to touch on, he is very far from
the reality. For silence at the proper season is wisdom, and better
than any speech. And that is, I <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>think, the reason why the
ancients instituted the mysteries that we, learning therein to be
silent, might transfer our secrecy to the gods to human affairs.
And no one ever yet repented of his silence, while multitudes have
repented of their speaking. And what has not been said is easy to
say, while what has been once said can never be recalled. I have
heard of myriads who have fallen into the greatest misfortunes
through inability to govern their tongues. Passing over the rest, I
will mention one or two cases in point. When Ptolemy Philadelphus
married his sister Arsinoe, Sotades said, "You are contracting an
unholy marriage."<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id=
"FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class=
"fnanchor">30</a> For this speech he long lingered in prison, and
paid the righteous penalty for his unseasonable babbling, and had
to weep a long time for making others laugh. Theocritus the Sophist
similarly cracked his jokes, and had to pay even a greater penalty.
For when Alexander ordered the Greeks to furnish him with purple
robes to wear at the sacrifices on his triumphal return from war
against the barbarians, and his subjects contributed so much per
head, Theocritus said, "Before I doubted, but now I am sure, that
this is the <i>purple death</i> Homer speaks of."<a name=

class="fnanchor">31</a> By this speech he made Alexander his enemy.
The same Theocritus put Antigonus, the King of the Macedonians, a
one-eyed man, into a thundering rage by alluding to his misfortune.
For the King sent his chief cook, Eutropio, an important person at
his court, to go and fetch Theocritus before him to confer with
him, and when he had frequently requested him to come without
avail, Theocritus at last said, "I know well you wish to serve me
up raw to the Cyclops;" flouting the King as one-eyed and the cook
with his profession. Eutropio replied, "You shall lose your head,
and pay the penalty for this babbling and mad insolence;" and
reported his words to the King, who sent and had his head taken
off. Our boys must also be taught to speak the truth as a most
sacred duty; for to lie is servile, and most hateful in all men,
hardly to be pardoned even in poor slaves.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> Thus much have I said
about the good conduct <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id=
"Page_17">17</a></span>and self-control of boys without any doubt
or hesitation: but as to what I am now going to say I am doubtful
and undecided, and like a person weighed in the scales against
exactly his weight, and feel great hesitation as to whether I
should recommend or dissuade the practice. But I must speak out.
The question is this&mdash;whether we ought to let the lovers of
our boys associate and be with them, or on the contrary, debar them
from their company and scare them off. For when I look at fathers
self-opinionated sour and austere, who think their sons having
lovers a disgrace not to be borne, I am rather afraid of
recommending the practice. But when, on the other hand, I think of
Socrates, Xenophon, &AElig;schines, Cebes, and all the company of
those men who have approved of male loves, and who have introduced
their minions to learning, to high positions in the State, and to
good morals, I change my opinion, and am moved to emulate those
men. And Euripides seems to favour these views in the passage, "But
there is among mortals another love, that of the righteous
temperate and pure soul."<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id=
"FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class=
"fnanchor">32</a> Nor must we omit the remark of Plato, which seems
to mix seriousness with mirth, that "those who have distinguished
themselves ought to be permitted to kiss any handsome boy they
like."<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Those then that seek only
carnal enjoyment must be kept off, but those that love the soul
must be encouraged. And while the loves common at Thebes and Elis,
and the so-called rape at Crete, must be avoided, the loves of
Athens and Laced&aelig;mon should be emulated.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> As to this matter,
therefore, let every parent follow his inclination. And now, as I
have spoken about the good and decent behaviour of boys, I shall
change my subject and speak a little about youths. For I have often
censured the introducers of bad habits, who have set over boys
tutors and preceptors, but have given to youths full liberty, when
they ought, on the contrary, to have watched and guarded them more
than boys. For who does not know that the offences of boys are
petty and easily cured, and proceed from the carelessness of tutors
or want of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id=
"Page_18">18</a></span>obedience to preceptors; but the faults of
young men are often grave and serious, as gluttony, and robbing
their fathers, and dice, and revellings, and drinking-bouts, and
deflowering of maidens, and seducing of married women. Such
outbreaks ought to be carefully checked and curbed. For that prime
of life is prodigal in pleasure, and frisky, and needs a bridle, so
that those parents who do not strongly check that period, are
foolishly, if unawares, giving their youths license for vice.<a
name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> Sensible parents,
therefore, ought during all that period to guard and watch and
restrain their youths, by precepts, by threats, by entreaties, by
advice, by promises, by citing examples,<a name="FNanchor_35_35"
id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class=
"fnanchor">35</a> on the one hand, of those who have come to ruin
by being too fond of pleasure, on the other hand, of those who by
their self-control have attained to praise and good report. For
these are, as it were, the two elements of virtue, hope of honour,
and fear of punishment; the former inciting to good practices, the
latter deterring from bad.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvii.</span> We ought, at all
hazards, to keep our boys also from association with bad men, for
they will catch some of their villany. This was the meaning of
Pythagoras' enigmatical precepts, which I shall quote and explain,
as they give no slight momentum towards the acquisition of virtue:
as, <i>Do not touch black tails</i>: that is, do not associate with
bad men.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> <i>Do not go beyond the
balance</i>: that is, we must pay the greatest attention to justice
and not go beyond it. <i>Do not sit on a measure</i>: that is, do
not be lazy, but earn tomorrow's bread as well as to-day's. <i>Do
not give everyone your right hand</i>: that is, do not be too ready
to strike up a friendship. <i>Do not wear a tight ring</i>: that
is, let your life be free, do not bind yourself by a chain. <i>Do
not poke the fire with a sword</i>: that is, do not provoke an
angry person, but yield to such. <i>Do not eat the heart</i>: do
not wear away the heart by anxiety. <i>Abstain from beans</i>: that
is, do not meddle in state affairs, for the voting for offices was
formerly taken by beans. <i>Do not put your food in the
chamber-pot</i>: that is, do not throw your pearls before swine,
for words are the food of the mind, and the villany of men <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>twist
them to a corrupt meaning. <i>When you have come to the end of a
journey do not look back</i>: that is, when people are going to die
and see that their end is near, they ought to take it easily and
not be dejected. But I will return from my digression. We must keep
our boys, as I said, from association with all bad men, but
especially from flatterers. For, as I have often said to parents,
and still say, and will constantly affirm, there is no race more
pestilential, nor more sure to ruin youths swiftly, than the race
of flatterers, who destroy both parents and sons root and branch,
making the old age of the one and the youth of the others
miserable, holding out pleasure as a sure bait. The sons of the
rich are by their fathers urged to be sober, but by them to be
drunk; by their fathers to be chaste, by them to wax wanton; by
their fathers to save, by them to spend; by their fathers to be
industrious, by them to be lazy. For they say, "'Our life's but a
span;'<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> we can only live once;
why should you heed your father's threats? he's an old twaddler, he
has one foot in the grave; we shall soon hoist him up and carry him
off to burial." Some even pimp for them and supply them with
prostitutes or even married women, and cut huge slices off the
father's savings for old age, if they don't run off with them
altogether. An accursed tribe, feigning friendship, knowing nothing
of real freedom, flatterers of the rich, despisers of the poor,
drawn to young men by a sort of natural logic,<a name=
"FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38"
class="fnanchor">38</a> showing their teeth and grinning all over
when their patrons laugh,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id=
"FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class=
"fnanchor">39</a> misbegotten brats of fortune and bastard elements
in life, living according to the nod of the rich, free in their
circumstances, but slaves by inclination, when they are not
insulted thinking themselves insulted, because they are parasites
to no purpose. So, if any father cares for the good bringing-up of
his sons, he must banish from his house this abominable race. He
must also be on his guard against the viciousness of his sons'
schoolfellows, for they are quite sufficient to corrupt the best
morals.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xviii.</span> What I have said
hitherto is <i>apropos</i> to my <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>subject: I will now speak a
word to the men. Parents must not be over harsh and rough in their
natures, but must often forgive their sons' offences, remembering
that they themselves were once young. And just as doctors by
infusing a sweet flavour into their bitter potions find delight a
passage to benefit, so fathers must temper the severity of their
censure by mildness; and sometimes relax and slacken the reins of
their sons' desires, and again tighten them; and must be especially
easy in respect to their faults, or if they are angry must soon
cool down. For it is better for a father to be hot-tempered than
sullen, for to continue hostile and irreconcilable looks like
hating one's son. And it is good to seem not to notice some faults,
but to extend to them the weak sight and deafness of old age, so as
seeing not to see, and hearing not to hear, their doings. We
tolerate the faults of our friends; why should we not that of our
sons? often even our slaves' drunken debauches we do not expose.
Have you been rather near? spend more freely. Have you been vexed?
let the matter pass. Has your son deceived you by the help of a
slave? do not be angry. Did he take a yoke of oxen from the field,
did he come home smelling of yesterday's debauch? wink at it. Is he
scented like a perfume shop? say nothing. Thus frisky youth gets
broken in.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_20a" id="Page_20a" />&sect; <span class=
"smcap">xix.</span> Those of our sons who are given to pleasure and
pay little heed to rebuke, we must endeavour to marry, for marriage
is the surest restraint upon youth. And we must marry our sons to
wives not much richer or better born, for the proverb is a sound
one, "Marry in your own walk of life."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id=
"FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class=
"fnanchor">41</a> For those who marry wives superior to themselves
in rank are not so much the husbands of their wives as unawares
slaves to their dowries.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id=
"FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class=
"fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xx.</span> I shall add a few remarks,
and then bring my subject to a close. Before all things fathers
must, by a good behaviour, set a good example to their sons, that,
looking at their lives as a mirror, they may turn away from <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>bad
deeds and words. For those fathers who censure their sons' faults
while they themselves commit the same, are really their own
accusers, if they know it not, under their sons' name; and those
who live a depraved life have no right to censure their slaves, far
less their sons. And besides this they will become counsellors and
teachers of their sons in wrongdoing; for where old men are
shameless youths will of a certainty have no modesty. We must
therefore take all pains to teach our sons self-control, emulating
the conduct of Eurydice, who, though an Illyrian and more than a
barbarian, to teach her sons educated herself though late in life,
and her love to them is well depicted in the inscription which she
offered to the Muses: "Eurydice of Hierapolis made this offering to
the Muses, having conceived a vast love for knowledge. For when a
mother with sons full-grown she learnt letters, the preservers of
knowledge."</p>

<p>To carry out all these precepts would be perhaps a visionary
scheme; but to attain to many, though it would need a happy
disposition and much care, is a thing possible to human nature.<a

<h3><a name="Page_21a" id="Page_21a">ON LOVE TO ONE'S
OFFSPRING.</a></h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Appeals to foreign
law-courts were first devised among the Greeks through mistrust of
one another's justice, for they looked on justice as a necessity
not indigenous among them. Is it not on much the same principle
that the philosophers, in regard to some of their questions, owing
to their variety of opinion, have appealed to the brute creation as
to a strange state, and submitted the decision to their instincts
and habits as not to be talked over <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>and impartial? Or is it a
general charge against human infirmity that, having different
opinions on the most necessary and important things, we seek in
horses and dogs and birds how to marry and beget and rear children,
as though we had no means of making our own nature known, and
appeal to the habits and instincts of the brute creation, and call
them in to bear witness against the many deviations from nature in
our lives, which from the first are confused and disorderly. For
among the brutes nature remains ever the same, pure and simple, but
in men, owing to reason and habit, like oil in the hands of the
perfumers, being mixed up with many added opinions, it becomes
various and loses its original simplicity. And let us not wonder
that the brutes follow nature more closely than human beings, for
in that respect even they are outstripped by inanimate things,
which, being dowered neither with imagination nor any appetite or
inclination contrary to nature, ever continue in the one path which
nature has prescribed for them, as if they were tied and bound. But
in brutes the gentleness of mood inspired by reason, the subtlety,
the love of freedom, are not qualities found in excess, but they
have unreasonable appetites and desires, and act in a roundabout
way within certain limits, riding, as it were, at the anchor of
nature, and only going straight under bit and bridle. But in man
reason, which is absolute master, inventing different modes and
fashions of life, has left no plain or evident trace of nature.<a

"#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_22a" id="Page_22a" />&sect; <span class=
"smcap">ii.</span> Consider in their marriages how much the animals
follow nature. For they do not wait for any legislation about
bachelor or late-married, like the citizens of Lycurgus and Solon,
nor do they fear penalties for childlessness, nor are they anxious
for the <i>jus trium liberorum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id=
"FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class=
"fnanchor">45</a> like many of the Romans, who only marry and have
children for the privileges it bestows, not to have heirs, but to
be qualified for succeeding themselves to inheritances. Then,
again, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id=
"Page_23">23</a></span>the male animal does not go with the female
at all times; for its aim is not pleasure but procreation: so in
the season of spring, the most appropriate time for such
pairings,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> the female being
submissive and tender attracts the male by her beautiful condition
of body, coming as she does from the dew and fresh pastures, and
when pregnant modestly retires and takes thought for the birth and
safety of her offspring. We cannot adequately describe all this,
but every animal exhibits for its young affection and forethought
and endurance and unselfishness. We call the bee wise, and
celebrate its "making the yellow honey,"<a name="FNanchor_47_47"
id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class=
"fnanchor">47</a> flattering it for its tickling sweetness; but we
neglect the wisdom and ingenuity of other creatures, both as
regards the birth and bringing up of their young. For example, the
kingfisher after conception weaves its nest with the thorns of the
marine needle, making it round and oblong in shape like a
fisherman's basket, and after deftly and closely weaving it
together, subjects it to the action of the sea waves, that its
surface may be rendered waterproof by this plash and cement, and it
is hard for even iron or stone to break it. And what is more
wonderful still, so symmetrically is the entrance of the nest
adjusted to the kingfisher's shape and size, that no beast either
greater or smaller can enter it, they even say that it does not
admit the sea, or even the very smallest things. And cats, when
they breed, very often let their kittens go out and feed, and take
them back into their entrails again.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id=
"FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class=
"fnanchor">48</a> And the bear, a most savage and ugly beast, gives
birth to its young without shape or joints, and with its tongue as
with an instrument moulds its features, so that it seems to give
form as well as life to its progeny. And the lion in Homer, "whom
the hunters meet in the wood with its whelps, exulting in its
strength, which so frowns that it hides its eyes,"<a name=
"FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49"
class="fnanchor">49</a> does it not intend to bargain with the
hunters for its whelps? For universally the love of animals for
their offspring makes timid ones bold, and lazy ones energetic, and
greedy ones <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id=
"Page_24">24</a></span>unselfish. And so the bird in Homer, feeding
its young "with its beak, with whatever it has captured, even
though it goes ill with itself,"<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id=
"FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class=
"fnanchor">50</a> nourishes its young at the cost of its own
hunger, and when the food is near its maw abstains from it, and
holds it tightly in its mouth, that it may not gulp it down
unawares. "And so a bitch bestriding her tender pups, barks at a
strange man, and yearns for the fray,"<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id=
"FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class=
"fnanchor">51</a> making her fear for them a sort of second anger.
And partridges when they are pursued with their young let them fly
on, and, contriving their safety, themselves fly so near the
sportsmen as to be almost caught, and then wheel round, and again
fly back and make the sportsmen hope to catch them, till at last,
having thus provided for the safety of their young, they lead the
sportsmen on a long way. As to hens, we see every day how they
watch over their chicks, dropping their wings over some, and
letting others climb on their backs, or anywhere about them, and
clucking for joy all the time: and though they fly from dogs and
dragons when only afraid for themselves, if they are afraid for
their chicks they stand their ground and fight valiantly. Are we to
suppose then that nature has only implanted these instincts in
fowls and dogs and bears, anxious only about their offspring, to
put us mortals out of countenance and to give us a bad name?
considering these examples for us to follow, while disgrace justly
attaches to our inhumanity, for mankind only is accused of having
no disinterested affection, and of not knowing how to love except
in regard to advantage. For that line is greatly admired in the
theatres, "Man loves man only for reward," and is the view of
Epicurus, who thinks that the father so loves his son, the mother
her child, children their parents. Whereas, if the brutes could
understand conversation, and if anyone were to introduce horses and
cows and dogs and birds into a common theatre,<a name=
"FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52"
class="fnanchor">52</a> and were to change the sentiment into
"neither do dogs love their pups, nor horses their foals, nor birds
their young, out <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id=
"Page_25">25</a></span>of interest, but gratuitously and by
nature," it would be recognized by the affections of all of them to
be a true sentiment. Why it would be disgraceful, great God, that
birth and travail and procreation should be gratis and mere nature
among the beasts, while among mankind they should be merely
mercenary transactions!</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> But such a statement is
not true or worthy of credit. For as nature, in wild growths, such
as wild vines, wild figs, or wild olives, makes the fruit imperfect
and inferior to the fruit of cultivated trees, so has she given to
the brutes an imperfect affection for their kind, one neither
marked by justice nor going beyond commodity: whereas to man, a
logical and social animal, she has taught justice and law, and
honour to the gods, and building of cities, and philanthropy, and
has contributed the noble and goodly and fruitful seeds of all
these in love to one's offspring, thereby following the very first
elements that are found in the construction of the body. For nature
is everywhere perfect and artistic and complete, and, to borrow the
expression of Erasistratus, has nothing tawdry about her: but one
cannot adequately describe all the processes appertaining to birth,
nor would it be perhaps decent to pry too closely into such hidden
matters, and to particularize too minutely all their wondrous
ingenuity. But her contrivance and dispensation of milk alone is
sufficient to prove nature's wonderful care and forethought. For
all the superfluous blood in women, that owing to their languor and
thinness of spirit floats about on the surface and oppresses them,
has a safety-valve provided by nature in the menses, which relieve
and cleanse the rest of the body, and fit the womb for conception
in due season. But after conception nature stops the menses, and
arrests the flow of the blood, using it as aliment for the babe in
the womb, until the time arrives for its birth, and it requires a
different kind of food. At this stage the blood is most ingeniously
changed into a supply of milk, not diffused all over the body, but
externally in the breasts, so that the babe can with its mouth
imbibe the gentle and soothing nutriment.<a name="FNanchor_53_53"
id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class=
"fnanchor">53</a> But all these various <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>processes of nature, all
this economy, all this forethought, would be useless, had not
nature also implanted in mothers love to their offspring and
anxiety for their welfare.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"For of all things, that on
the earth do breathe</span> <span class="i0">Or creep, man is by
far the wretchedest."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id=
"FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class=
"fnanchor">54</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>And the poet's words are especially applicable to a newborn
babe. For there is nothing so imperfect, so helpless, so naked, so
shapeless, so foul as a newborn babe: to whom almost alone nature
has given an impure outlet to the light of day: being kneaded with
blood, and full of defilement, and like one killed rather than
born: which no one would touch, or lift up, or kiss, or embrace,
but from natural affection. And that is why all the animals have
their udders under the belly, women alone have their breasts high
on their bodies, that they can lift up their babes to kiss, to
dandle, and to fondle: seeing that their bearing and rearing
children comes not from necessity but love.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Refer the question to the
ancient inhabitants of the earth, to the first mothers and fathers.
There was no law ordering them to have families, no expectation of
advantage or return to be got out of them. I should rather say that
mothers would be likely to be hostile and bear malice to their
babes, owing to the great danger and pains of travail. And women
say the lines, "When the sharp pangs of travail seize on the
pregnant woman, then come to her aid the Ilithyi&aelig;, who help
women in hard childbirth, those daughters of Hera, goddesses of
travail,"<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> were not written by
Homer, but by some Homerid who had been a mother, or was even then
in the throes of travail, and who vividly felt the sharp pain in
her womb. But the love to one's offspring implanted by nature,
moves and influences the mother even then: in the very height of
her throes, she neglects not nor flees from her babe, but turns to
it and smiles at it, and takes it up and caresses it, though she
derives no pleasure or utility from it, but with pain and sorrow
receives it, "warming it and fostering it <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>in swaddling clothes, with
unintermittent assiduity both night and day."<a name=
"FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56"
class="fnanchor">56</a> What hope of gain or advantage had they in
those days? nay, or even now? for the hopes of parents are
uncertain, and have to be long waited for. He who plants a vine in
the spring equinox, gleans its vintage in the autumnal equinox; he
who sows corn when the Pleiads set, reaps it when they rise; cattle
and horses and birds have produce at once fit for use; whereas
man's bringing up is toilsome, his growth slow; and as excellence
flowers late, most fathers die before their sons attain to fame.
Neocles lived not to see Themistocles' victory at Salamis, nor
Miltiades Cimon's at the Eurymedon, nor did Xanthippus hear
Pericles haranguing, nor did Aristo hear Plato philosophizing, nor
did their fathers know of the triumphs of Euripides and Sophocles.
They heard them faltering in speech and lisping in syllables, the
poor parents saw their errors in revelling and drinking and
love-affairs, so that of all Evenus'<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id=
"FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class=
"fnanchor">57</a> lines, that one alone is most remembered and
quoted, "to a father a son is always a cause of fear or pain."
Nevertheless, parents do not cease to bring up sons, even when they
can least need them. For it is ridiculous to suppose that the rich,
when they have sons, sacrifice and rejoice that they will have
people to take care of them and to bury them; unless indeed they
bring up sons from want of heirs; as if one could not find or fall
in with anyone who would be willing to have another's property!
Why, the sand on the sea shore, and the dust, and the wings of
birds of varied note, are less numerous than the number of would-be
heirs. For had Danaus, the father of fifty daughters, been
childless, he would have had more heirs, and of a different spirit.
For sons have no gratitude, nor regard, nor veneration for
inheritance; but take it as a debt; whereas the voices of strangers
which you hear round the childless man, are like those lines in the
play, "O People, first bathe, after one decision in the courts,
then eat, drink, gobble, take the three-obol-piece."<a name=
"FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58"
class="fnanchor">58</a> And what Euripides has said, "Money finds
friends for men, and has the greatest <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>power among mankind," is
not merely a general truth, but is especially true in the case of
the childless. For those the rich entertain to dinner, those great
men pay court to, to those alone orators give their services
gratis. "A mighty personage is a rich man, whose heir is unknown."
It has at any rate made many much loved and honoured, whom the
possession of one child would have made unloved and insignificant.
Whence we see that there is no power or advantage to be got from
children, but that the love of them, alike in mankind as among the
animals, proceeds entirely from nature.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> What if this natural
affection, like many other virtues, is obscured by badness, as a
wilderness chokes a garden? Are we to say that man does not love
himself by nature, because many cut their throats or throw
themselves down precipices? Did not &OElig;dipus put out his eyes?
And did not Hegesias by his speeches make, many of his hearers to
commit suicide?<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a
href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> "Fatality has many
different aspects."<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id=
"FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class=
"fnanchor">60</a> But all these are diseases and maladies of the
soul driving a man contrary to nature out of his wits: as men
themselves testify even against themselves. For if a sow destroys
one of its litter, or a bitch one of its pups, men are dejected and
troubled, and think it an evil omen, and sacrifice to the gods to
avert any bad results, on the score that it is natural to all to
love and cherish their offspring, unnatural to destroy it. For just
as in mines the gold is conspicuous even though mixed up with
earth, so nature manifests plainly love to offspring even in
instances of faulty habits and affections. For when the poor do not
rear their children, it is from fear that if reared to man's estate
they would be more than ought to be the case servile, and have
little culture, and be debarred of all advantages: so, thinking
poverty the worst of all evils, they cannot bear to give it their
children, any more than they would some bad disease.<a name=

<h3>ON LOVE.</h3>

<p class="two">FLAVIANUS AND AUTOBULUS, THE OPENERS OF THE
DIALOGUE, ARE BROTHERS. THE OTHER SPEAKERS ARE THEIR FATHER,
DAPHN&AElig;US, PROTOGENES, PISIAS, AND OTHERS.</p>

<p><a name="Page_29a" id="Page_29a" />&sect; <span class=
"smcap">i.</span> <i>Flavianus.</i>&mdash;You say that it was on
Mount Helicon, Autobulus, that those conversations took place about
Love, which you are now about to narrate to us at our request, as
you either wrote them down, or at least remember them from
frequently asking our father about them.</p>

<p><i>Autobulus.</i>&mdash;It was on Mount Helicon among the Muses,
Flavianus, when the people of Thespi&aelig; were celebrating their
Festival to the God of Love, which they celebrate very
magnificently and splendidly every five years to that God, as also
to the Muses.</p>

<p><i>Flavianus.</i>&mdash;Do you know what all of us who have come
to this audience intend to ask of you?</p>

<p><i>Autobulus.</i>&mdash;No, but I shall know if you tell me.</p>

<p><i>Flavianus.</i>&mdash;Remove from your discourse for this once
the poet's meadows and shades, and talk about ivy and yews, and all
other commonplaces of that kind that writers love to introduce,
with more zeal than discretion, in imitation of Plato's Ilissus and
the famous willow and the gentle slope of grass.<a name=
"FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62"
class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

<p><i>Autobulus.</i>&mdash;My dear Flavianus, my narrative needs
not any such exordium. The occasion that caused the conversation
simply demands a chorus for the action and a stage, nothing else is
wanting to the drama, let us only pray to the Mother of the Muses
to be propitious, and give me memory for my narrative.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> Long ago our father,
before we were born, having lately married our mother, had gone to
sacrifice to the God of Love, in consequence of a dispute and
variance that broke out among their parents, and took our mother to
the Festival, for she also had her part in the vow and sacrifice.
Some of their intimate friends journeyed with them from the town
where they lived, and when they got to Thespi&aelig; <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>they found
there Daphn&aelig;us the son of Archidamus, a lover of Lysandra the
daughter of Simo, and of all her suitors the one who stood highest
in her favour, and Soclarus the son of Aristio, who had come from
Tithorea. And there were there also Protogenes of Tarsus, and
Zeuxippus from Sparta, strangers, and my father said most of the
most notable B&oelig;otians were there also. For two or three days
they went about the town in one another's company, as it was likely
they would do, quietly carrying on philosophical discussions in the
wrestling-schools and theatres: after that, to avoid a wearisome
contest of harpers, decided beforehand by canvassing and cabal,
most broke up their camp as if they had been in a hostile country,
and removed to Mount Helicon, and bivouacked there with the Muses.
In the morning they were visited by Anthemion and Pisias, both men
of good repute, and very great friends of Baccho, who was surnamed
the Handsome, and also rivals of one another somewhat through their
affection for him. Now you must know that there was at
Thespi&aelig; a lady called Ismenodora, famous for her wealth and
good family, and of uncommon good repute for her virtuous life: for
she had been a widow some time without a breath of slander lighting
upon her, though she was young and good-looking. As Baccho was the
son of a friend and crony of hers, she had tried to bring about a
marriage between him and a maiden who was her own relation, but by
frequently being in his company and talking to him she had got
rather smitten with him herself. And hearing much in his favour,
and often talking about him, and seeing that many noble young men
were in love with him, she fell violently in love with him, and,
being resolved to do nothing unbecoming to her fair fame,
determined to marry and live openly with him. And the matter
seeming in itself rather odd, Baccho's mother looked rather askance
at the proposed matrimonial alliance as being too high and splendid
for her son, while some of his companions who used to go out
hunting with him, frightening him and flouting him with
Ismenodora's being rather too old for him, really did more to break
off the match than those who seriously opposed it. And Baccho,
being only a youth, somehow felt a little ashamed at the idea
of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id=
"Page_31">31</a></span> marrying a widow, but, neglecting the
opinions of everybody else, he submitted the decision as to the
expediency of the marriage to Pisias and Anthemion, the latter
being his cousin, though older than him, and the former the
gravest<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> of his lovers. Pisias
objected to the marriage, and upbraided Anthemion with throwing the
youth away on Ismenodora. Anthemion replied that it was not well in
Pisias, being a good fellow in other respects, to imitate depraved
lovers by shutting out his friend from house and marriage and
wealth, merely that he might enjoy the sight of him as long as
possible naked and in all his virgin bloom at the
wrestling-schools.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> To avoid getting
estranged by provoking one another on the question, they came and
chose our father and his companions as umpires on the matter. And
of the other friends, as if by concerted arrangement,
Daphn&aelig;us espoused the view of Anthemion, and Protogenes the
view of Pisias. And Protogenes inveighing somewhat too freely
against Ismenodora, Daphn&aelig;us took him up and said, "Hercules,
what are we not to expect, if Protogenes is going to be hostile to
love? he whose whole life, whether in work or at play, has been
devoted to love, in forgetfulness of letters, in forgetfulness of
his country, not like Laius, away from his country only five days,
his was only a torpid and land love: whereas your love 'unfolding
its swift wings,' flew over the sea from Cilicia to Athens, merely
to gaze at and saunter about with handsome boys. For that was the
original reason, doubtless, of Protogenes' journey abroad."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> And some laughter ensuing,
Protogenes replied, "Do I really seem to you now to be hostile to
love, and not to be fighting for love against ungovernable lust,
which with most disgraceful acts and emotions assumes the most
honourable of titles?" Whereupon Daphn&aelig;us, "Do you call the
marriage and union of man and woman most disgraceful, than which no
holier tie exists nor ever <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32"
id="Page_32">32</a></span>did?" Protogenes replied, "Why, as all
this is necessary for the human race to continue, our legislators
do not act amiss in crying up marriage and eulogizing it to the
masses, but of genuine love there is not a particle in the woman's
side of a house;<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a
href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> and I also say that
you who are sweet on women and girls only love them as flies love
milk, and bees the honey-comb, and butchers and cooks calves and
birds, fattening them up in darkness.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id=
"FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class=
"fnanchor">65</a> But as nature leads one to eat and drink
moderately and sufficiently, and excess in this is called gluttony
and gormandizing, so the mutual desires between men and women are
natural; but that headlong, violent, and uncontrollable passion for
the sex is not rightly called love. For love, when it seizes a
noble and young soul, ends in virtue through friendship; but these
violent passions for women, at the best, aim only at carnal
enjoyment and reaping the harvest of a beauteous prime, as
Aristippus showed in his answer to one who told him Lais loved him
not, 'No more,' he said, 'do meat and wine love me, but I gladly
enjoy both.'<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a
href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> For the end of
passion is pleasure and fruition: but love, when it has once lost
the promise of friendship, will not remain and continue to cherish
merely for beauty that which gives it pain, where it gives no
return of friendship and virtue. You remember the husband in the
play saying to his wife, 'Do you hate me? I can bear that hatred
very easily, since of my dishonour I make money.' Not a whit more
really in love than this husband is the one, who, not for gain but
merely for the sexual appetite, puts up with a peevish and
unsympathetic wife, as Philippides, the comic poet, ridiculed the
orator, Stratocles, 'You scarce can kiss her if she turns her back
on you.' If, however, we ought to give the name of love to this
passion, then is it an effeminate and bastard love, and like at
Cynosarges,<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a
href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> taking us to the
woman's side of the house: or rather as <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>they say there is a
genuine mountain eagle, which Homer called 'black, and a bird of
prey,' and there are other kinds of spurious eagles, which catch
fish and lazy birds in marshes, and often in want of food emit an
hungry wail: so the genuine love is the love of boys, a love not
'flashing with desire,' as Anacreon said the love of maidens was,
nor 'redolent of ointment and sprightly,' but you will see it plain
and without airs in the schools of the philosophers, or perhaps in
the gymnasiums and wrestling-schools, keenly and nobly pursuing
youths, and urging on to virtue those who are well worthy of
attention: but that soft and stay-at-home love, spending all its
time in women's bosoms and beds, always pursuing effeminate
delights, and enervated by unmanly, unfriendly, and unimpassioned
pleasures, we ought to condemn as Solon condemned it: for he
forbade slaves to love boys or to anoint them with oil, while he
allowed them to associate with women. For friendship is noble and
refined, whereas pleasure is vulgar and illiberal. Therefore, for a
slave to love boys is neither liberal or refined: for it is merely
the love of copulation, as the love of women."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> Protogenes was intending to
go on at greater length, when Daphn&aelig;us stopped him and said,
"You do well, by Zeus, to mention Solon, and we too may use him as
the test of an amorous man. Does he not define such a one in the
lines, 'As long as you love boys in the glorious flower of their
youth for their kisses and embraces.' And add to Solon the lines of
&AElig;schylus, 'You did not disdain the honour of the thighs, O
thankless one after all my frequent kisses.'<a name=
"FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68"
class="fnanchor">68</a> For some laugh at them if they bid lovers,
like sacrificing priests and seers, to inspect thighs and loins;
but I think this a mighty argument in behalf of the love of women.
For if the unnatural commerce with males does not take away or mar
the amorous propensity, much more likely is it that the natural
love of women will end in friendship after the favour. For,
Protogenes, the yielding of the female to the male was called by
the ancients the favour. Thus Pindar says Heph&aelig;stus was the
son of Hera <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id=
"Page_34">34</a></span>'without any favours':<a name=
"FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69"
class="fnanchor">69</a> and Sappho, addressing a girl not yet ripe
for marriage, says to her, 'You seemed to me a little girl, too
young for the favour.' And someone asks Hercules, 'Did you obtain
the girl's favour by force or by persuasion?' But the love of males
for males, whether rape or voluntary&mdash;pathicks effeminately
submitting, to use Plato's words, 'to be treated
bestially'&mdash;is altogether a foul and unlovely favour. And so I
think Solon wrote the lines quoted above 'in his hot youth,' as
Plato puts it; but when he became older wrote these other lines,
'Now I delight in Cyprus-born Aphrodite, and in Dionysus, and in
the Muses: all these give joys to men': as if, after the heat and
tempest of his boyish loves, he had got into a quiet haven of
marriage and philosophy. But indeed, Protogenes, if we look at the
real facts of the case, the love for boys and women is really one
and the same passion: but if you wish in a disputatious spirit to
make any distinction, you will find that this boy-love goes beyond
all bounds, and, like some late-born and ill-begotten bastard brat,
seeks to expel its legitimate brother the older love, the love of
women. For indeed, friend, it is only yesterday or the day before,
since the strippings and exposures of the youths in the gymnasiums,
that this boy-love crept in, and gently insinuated itself and got a
footing, and at last in a little time got fully-fledged in the
wrestling-schools, and has now got fairly unbearable, and insults
and tramples on conjugal love, that love that gives immortality to
our mortal race, when our nature has been extinguished by death,
kindling it again by new births. And this boy-love denies that
pleasure is its aim: for it is ashamed and afraid to confess the
truth: but it needs some specious excuse for the liberties it takes
with handsome boys in their prime: the pretext is friendship and
virtue. So your boy-lover wallows in the dust, bathes in cold
water, raises his eyebrows, gives himself out for a philosopher,
and lives chaste abroad because of the law: but in the stillness of
night</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Sweet is the ripe fruit when

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id=
"Page_35">35</a></span> But if, as Protogenes says, there is no
carnal intercourse in these boy-familiarities, how is it Love, if
Aphrodite is not present, whom it is the destiny of Love to cherish
and pay court to, and to partake of just as much honour and power
as she assigns to him? But if there is any Love without Aphrodite,
as there is drunkenness without wine in drinks made from figs and
barley, the disturbing it will be fruitless and without effect, and
surfeiting and disgusting."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> At the conclusion of this
speech, it was clear that Pisias was vexed and indignant with
Daphn&aelig;us; and after a moment's silence he began: "O Hercules!
what levity and audacity for men to state that they are tied to
women as dogs to bitches, and to banish the god of Love from the
gymnasiums and public walks, and light of day and open intercourse,
and to restrict him to brothels<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id=
"FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class=
"fnanchor">71</a> and philtres and incantations of wanton women:
for to chaste women, I am sure, it belongs not either to love or be
loved." At this point our father told me he interposed, and took
Protogenes by the hand, and said to him:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"'This word of yours rouses
the Argive host,'</span></div>
</div>

<p>and of a verity Pisias makes us to side with Daphn&aelig;us by
his extravagant language, charging marriage with being a loveless
intercourse, and one that has no participation in divine
friendship, although we can see that it is an intercourse, if
erotic persuasion and favour fail, that cannot be restrained by
shame and fear as by bit and bridle." Thereupon Pisias said, "I
care little about his arguments; but I see that Daphn&aelig;us is
in the same condition as brass: for, just as it is not worked upon
so much by the agency of fire as by the molten and liquid brass
fused with it, so is he not so much captivated by the beauty of
Lysandra as by his association with one who is the victim of the
gentle passion; and it is plain that, if he doesn't take refuge
with <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id=
"Page_36">36</a></span>us, he will soon melt away in the flame
altogether. But I see, what Anthemion would very much like, that I
am offending the Court, so I stop." "You amuse us," said Anthemion:
"but you ought from the first to have spoken to the point."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> "I say then," continued
Pisias, "and give it out boldly, as far as I am concerned, let
every woman have a lover; but we ought to guard against giving the
wealth of Ismenodora to Baccho, lest, if we involve him in so much
grandeur and magnificence, we unwittingly lose him in it, as tin is
lost in brass. For if the lad were to marry quite a plain and
insignificant woman, it would be great odds whether he would keep
the upper hand, as wine mixed with water; and Ismenodora seems
already marked out for sway and command; for otherwise she would
not have rejected such illustrious and wealthy suitors to woo a lad
hardly yet arrived at man's estate, and almost requiring a tutor
still. And therefore men of sense prune the excessive wealth of
their wives, as if it had wings that required clipping; for this
same wealth implants in them luxury, caprice, and vanity, by which
they are often elated and fly away altogether: but if they remain,
it would be better to be bound by golden fetters, as in Ethiopia,
than to a woman's wealth."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> Here Protogenes put in,
"You say nothing about the risk we run of unseasonably and
ridiculously reversing the well-known advice of Hesiod:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'If seasonable marriage you
would make,</span> <span class="i0">Let about thirty be the
bridegroom's age,</span> <span class="i0">The bride be in the fifth
year of her womanhood:'<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id=
"FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class=
"fnanchor">72</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>if we thus marry a lad hardly old enough for marriage to a woman
so many years older, than himself, as dates and figs are forced.
You will say she loves him passionately: who prevents her, then,
from serenading at his doors, singing her amorous ditty, putting
garlands on his statues, and wrestling and boxing with her rivals
in his affections? For all these are what people in love do. And
let her lower her eyebrows, and give up the airs of a coquette, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id=
"Page_37">37</a></span>assume the appearance of those that are
deeply smitten. But if she is modest and chaste, let her decorously
stay at home and await there her lovers and sweethearts; for any
sensible man would be disgusted and flee from a woman who took the
initiative in love, far less would he be likely to marry her after
such a barefaced wooing."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> When Protogenes had done
speaking, my father said, "Do you see, Anthemion, that they force
us to intervene again, who have no objection to dance in the
retinue of conjugal Love?" "I do," said Anthernion, "but pray
defend Love at some length, as you are on his side, and moreover
come to the rescue of wealth,<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id=
"FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class=
"fnanchor">73</a> with which Pisias seeks to scare us." Thereupon
my father began, "What on earth will not be brought as a charge
against a woman, if we are to reject Ismenodora because she is in
love and has money? Granted she loves sway and is rich? What then,
if she is young and handsome? And what if she plumes herself
somewhat on the lustre of her race? Have not chaste women often
something of the morose and peevish in their character almost past
bearing? Do they not sometimes get called waspish and shrewish by
virtue of their very chastity? Would it be best then to marry off
the street some Thracian Abrotonus, or some Milesian Bacchis, and
seal the bargain by the present of a handful of nuts? But we have
known even such turn out intolerable tyrants, Syrian flute-girls
and ballet-dancers, as Aristonica, and &OElig;nanthe with her
tambourine, and Agathoclea, who have lorded it over kings'
diadems.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> Why Syrian Semiramis was
only the servant and concubine of one of king Ninus's slaves, till
Ninus the great king seeing and falling in love with her, she got
such power over him that she thought so cheap of him, that she
asked to be allowed one day to sit on the royal throne, with the
royal diadem on her head, and to transact state affairs. And <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>Ninus
having granted her permission, and having ordered all his subjects
to obey her as himself, she first gave several very moderate orders
to make trial of the guards; but when she saw that they obeyed her
without the slightest hesitation, she ordered them to seize Ninus
and put him in fetters, and at last put him to death; and all her
commands being obeyed, she ruled over Asia for a long time with
great lustre. And was not Belestiche a foreign woman off the
streets, although at Alexandria she has shrines and temples, with
an inscription as Aphrodite Belestiche, which she owes to the
king's love? And she who has in this very town<a name=
"FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75"
class="fnanchor">75</a> a temple and rites in common with Eros, and
at Delphi stands in gold among kings and queens, by what dowry got
she her lovers? But just as the lovers of Semiramis, Belestiche,
and Phryne, became their prey unconsciously through their weakness
and effeminacy, so on the other hand poor and obscure men, having
contracted alliances with rich women of rank, have not been thereby
spoilt nor merged their personality, but have lived with their
wives on a footing of kindness, yet still kept their position as
heads of the house. But he that abases his wife and makes her
small, like one who tightens the ring on a finger too small for it
fearing it will come off,<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id=
"FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class=
"fnanchor">76</a> is like those who cut their mares' tails off and
then take them to a river or pond to drink, when they say that
sorrowfully discerning their loss of beauty these mares lose their
self-respect and allow themselves to be covered by asses.<a name=
"FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77"
class="fnanchor">77</a> To select a wife for wealth rather than for
her excellence or family is dishonourable and illiberal; but it is
silly to reject wealth when it is accompanied by excellence and

Munychia<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> to make not only the
collar strong but the dog lean, that he might undermine the
strength of the Athenians; but it becomes not the husband of a rich
or handsome woman to make his wife poor or ugly, but by his
self-control<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id=
"Page_39">39</a></span> and good sense, and by not too
extravagantly showing his admiration for her, to exhibit himself as
her equal not her slave, and (to borrow an illustration from the
scales) to add just so much weight to his character as shall
over-balance her, yet only just. Moreover, both Ismenodora and
Baccho are of a suitable age for marriage and procreation of
children; Ismenodora, I hear, is still in her prime, and" (here my
father smiled slily at Pisias) "she is certainly not a bit older
than her rivals, and has no grey hairs, as some of those who
consort with Baccho have. And if their union is seasonable, who
knows but that she may be a better partner for him than any young
woman? For young couples do not blend and mix well together, and it
takes a long time and is not an easy process for them to divest
themselves of their pride and spirit, and at first there's a good
deal of dirty weather and they don't pull well together, and this
is oftenest the case when there's love on both sides, and, just as
a storm wrecks the ship if no pilot is on board, so their marriage
is trouble and confusion, neither party knowing how either to rule
or to give way properly. And if the baby is under the nurse, and
the boy under the master, and the lad under the master of the
gymnasium, and the youth under his lover, and the full-grown man
under the law and magistrate, and no one is his own master and
exempt from obedience to someone, what wonder would it be if a
sensible woman rather older than her husband would direct well the
life of a young man, being useful to him by reason of her superior
wisdom, and acceptable to him for her sweetness and gentleness? And
to sum up the whole matter," said he, "we B&oelig;otians ought to
revere Hercules, and so find no fault in any inequality of age in
marriages, seeing that he gave his own wife Megara in marriage to
Iolaus, though he was only sixteen and she three-and-thirty."<a
name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> As the conversation was
going on, our father said that a friend of Pisias came galloping up
from the town to report an act of marvellous audacity. Ismenodora,
it appears, thinking Baccho had no personal dislike to the <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>match,
but only stood in awe of his friends who tried to dissuade him from
it, determined that she would not let the young fellow slip through
her fingers. Accordingly, she sent for the most active and
intimate<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> of her male friends, and
for some of her female cronies, and instructed them as to what part
they should play, and waited for the hour when Baccho was
accustomed regularly to pass by her house on his way to the
wrestling-school. And as he passed by on this occasion with two or
three of his companions, anointed for the exercise, Ismenodora met
him at the door and just touched his cloak, and her friends rushed
out all together and prettily seized the pretty fellow as he was in
his cloak and jersey,<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id=
"FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class=
"fnanchor">81</a> and hurried him into the house and at once locked
the doors. And the women inside at once divested him of his cloak
and put on him a bridal robe; and the servants ran about the town
and put olive wreaths and laurel garlands at the doors of Baccho's
house as well as Ismenodora's, and a flute-girl went up and down
the street playing and singing the wedding-song. And some of the
inhabitants of Thespi&aelig; and the strangers laughed, others were
indignant and tried to make the superintendents of the gymnasium
move in the matter, for they have great power in Thespi&aelig; over
the youths, and pay great attention to their actions. And now there
was no more talk about the sports, but everyone left the theatre
for the neighbourhood of Ismenodora's house, and there stood in
groups talking and disputing about what had happened.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xi.</span> Now when Pisias' friend
had come up like an <i>aide-de-camp</i> in war, "bloody with
spurring, fiery red with haste," to report this news that
Ismenodora had seized Baccho, my father said that Zeuxippus smiled,
and being a great lover of Euripides repeated the line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Lady, though rich, thou hast
thy sex's feelings."</span></div>
</div>

<p>But Pisias jumped up and cried out, "Ye gods, what will be the
end of license like this which will overthrow our town? Already we
are fast tending to lawlessness through our independence. And yet
it is perhaps ridicu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id=
"Page_41">41</a></span>lous to be indignant about law and justice,
when nature itself is trampled upon by being thus subjected to
women? Saw even Lemnos ever the like of this?<a name=
"FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82"
class="fnanchor">82</a> Let us go," he continued, "let us go and
hand over to the women the gymnasium and council-hall, if the
townsmen have lost all their nerve." Pisias then left the company,
and Protogenes went with him, partly sympathizing with his
indignation, but still endeavouring to cool him. And Anthemion
said, "'Twas a bold deed and certainly does savour somewhat of
Lemnos&mdash;I own it now we are alone&mdash;this Ismenodora must
be most violently in love." Hereupon Soclarus said, with a sly
smile, "You don't think then that this rape and detention was an
excuse and stratagem on the part of a wily young man to escape from
the clutches of his lovers, and fly of his own volition to the arms
of a rich and handsome widow?" "Pray don't say so, Soclarus," said
Anthemion, "pray don't entertain any such suspicions of Baccho, for
even if he were not by nature most simple and na&iuml;ve, he would
not have concealed the matter from me to whom he divulges all his
secrets, especially as he knows that I have always been very
anxious he should marry Ismenodora. But as Heraclitus says truly,
It is more difficult to control love than anger; for whatever love
has a fancy to, it will buy even at the cost of life, money, and
reputation. Who lives a more quiet life in our town than
Ismenodora? When did ever any ugly rumour attach itself to her?
When did ever any breath of suspicion sully her house? Some divine
inspiration, beyond human calculation, seems now to have possessed
her."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xii.</span> Then Pemptides laughed
and said, "Of course you know that there is a certain disease of
the body called the sacred disease.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id=
"FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class=
"fnanchor">83</a> It is no wonder, therefore, if some call the
greatest and most insane passion of the soul sacred and divine.
However, as in Egypt I once saw two neighbours <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>disputing
when a serpent passed by them on the road, both calling it a good
omen, but each claiming the blessing as his alone; so seeing lately
that some of you drag Love to the men's apartments, while others
confine it to the women's side of the house, while all of you
regard it as a divine and superlative blessing, I do not wonder,
since it is a passion that has such power and honour, that those
who ought to banish it from every quarter and clip its wings do
themselves add to its influence and power. And hitherto I held my
peace, for I saw that the discussion turned rather on private than
public interests, but now that we have got rid of Pisias, I would
gladly hear from you to what they had an eye who first called Love
a god."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> Just as Pemptides had
left off, and our father was about to answer his question, another
messenger came from the town, sent by Ismenodora to summon
Anthemion, for the tumult had increased, and there was a difference
of opinion between the superintendents of the gymnasium, one
thinking they ought to demand the liberation of Baccho, the other
thinking they ought not to interfere. Anthemion got up at once and
went off. And our father, addressing Pemptides especially, said,
"You seem to me, my dear Pemptides, to be handling a great and bold
matter, or rather to be discussing things that ought not to be
discussed, in asking for a reason in each case for our opinion
about the gods. Our ancient and hereditary faith is sufficient, a
better argument than which we cannot either utter or find,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Not e'en if wisdom in our

</div>

<p>but if this common foundation and basis of all piety be
disturbed, and its stability and time-honoured ideas be unsettled,
it becomes undermined and is suspected by everybody. You have
heard, of course, what hot water Euripides got into, when he wrote
at the beginning of his 'Melanippe,'</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Zeus, whosoe'er he is, I do

<p>but if he changed the opening line, he had confidence, <span

well,<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href=

</div>

<p>And what difference is there between calling in question the
received opinion about Zeus or Athene, and that about Love? For it
is not now for the first time that Love asks for an altar and
sacrifices, nor is he a strange god introduced by foreign
superstition, as some Attis or Adonis, furtively smuggled in by
hermaphrodites and women, and secretly receiving honours not his
own, to avoid an indictment among the gods for coming among them
under false pretences. And when, my friend, you hear the words of
Empedocles,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Friendship is there too, of
same length and breadth,</span> <span class="i0">But with the
mind's eye only can you see it,</span> <span class="i0">Till with
the sight your very soul is thralled,'</span></div>
</div>

<p>you must suppose that they refer to Love. For this god is
invisible, but to be extolled by us as one of the very oldest gods.
And if you demand proofs about every one of the gods, laying a
profane hand on every temple, and bringing a learned doubt to every
altar, you will scrutinize and pry into everything. But we need not
go far to find Love's pedigree.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'See you how great a goddess
Aphrodite is?</span> <span class="i0">She 'tis that gave us and
engendered Love,</span> <span class="i0">Whereof come all that on
the earth do live.'<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id=
"FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class=
"fnanchor">88</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>And so Empedocles calls Aphrodite <i>Life-giving</i>,<a name=
"FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89"
class="fnanchor">89</a> and Sophocles calls her <i>Fruitful</i>,
both very appropriate epithets. And though the wonderful act of
generation belongs to Aphrodite only, and Love is only present in
it as a subordinate, yet if he be absent the whole affair becomes
undesirable, and low, and tame. For a loveless coition brings only
satiety, as the satisfaction of hunger and thirst, and has nothing
noble resulting from it, whereas by Love Aphrodite removes the
cloying element in pleasure, and <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>produces harmonious friendship.
And so Parmenides declares Love to be the oldest of the creations
of Aphrodite, writing in his Cosmogony,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Of all the gods first Love
she did contrive.'</span></div>
</div>

<p>But Hesiod, more naturally in my opinion, makes Love the most
ancient of all, so that all things derive their existence from
him.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> If we then deprive Love
of his ancient honours, those of Aphrodite will be lost also. For
we cannot argue that, while some revile Love, all spare Aphrodite,
for on the same stage we hear of Love,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Love is an idle thing and for
the idle:'<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>and again of Aphrodite,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Cypris, my boys, is not her
only name,</span> <span class="i0">For many names has she. She is a
hell,</span> <span class="i0">A power remorseless, nay a raging
madness.'<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Just as in the case of the other gods there is hardly one that
has not been reviled, or escaped the scurrility of ignorance. Look,
for example, at Ares, who may be considered as it were the
counterpart of Love, what honours he has received from men, and
again what abuse, as</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Ares is blind, ye women, has

<p>And Homer calls him 'blood-stained' and 'fickle.'<a name=
"FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94"
class="fnanchor">94</a> And Chrysippus brings a grievous charge
against him, in defining his name to mean destroyer,<a name=
"FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95"
class="fnanchor">95</a> thereby giving a handle to those who think
that Ares is only the fighting, wrangling, and quarrelsome instinct
among mankind. Others again will tell us that Aphrodite is simply
desire, and Hermes eloquence, and the Muses the arts and sciences,
and Athene wisdom. You see what an abyss of impiety opens up before
us, if we describe each of the gods, as only a passion, a power, or
a virtue!"</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> "I see it," said
Pemptides, "and it is impious either to make the gods passions, or
to do just the con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id=
"Page_45">45</a></span>trary, and make the passions gods." "What
then?" said my father, "do you consider Ares a god, or only a human
passion?" And Pemptides, answering that he looked on Ares as god of
the passionate and manly element in mankind, "What," cried my
father, "shall the passionate and warlike and antagonistic
instincts in man have a god, but the affectionate and social and
clubable have none? Shall Ares, under his names of Enyalius and
Stratius, preside over arms and war and sieges and sacks of cities,
and shall there be no god to witness and preside over, to direct
and guide, conjugal affection, that friendship of closest union and
communion? Why even those who hunt gazelles and hares and deer have
a silvan deity who harks and halloos them on, for to
Arist&aelig;us<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a

when in pitfalls and snares they trap wolves and bears,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'For Arist&aelig;us first set
traps for animals.'</span></div>
</div>

<p>And Hercules invoked another god, when he was about to shoot at
the bird, as the line of &AElig;schylus shows,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Hunter Apollo, make my bolt
go straight!'<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a
href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>And shall no god or good genius assist and prosper the man who
hunts in the best chase of all, the chase of friendship? For I
cannot for my part, my dear Daphn&aelig;us, consider man a less
beautiful or important plant than the oak, or sacred olive, or the
vine which Homer glorifies,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id=
"FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class=
"fnanchor">98</a> seeing that man too has his growth and glorious
prime alike of soul and body."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> Then said Daphn&aelig;us,
"In the name of the gods, who thinks differently?" "All those
certainly must," answered my father, "who think that the gods care
only about ploughing and planting and sowing. Have they not Nymphs
attending upon them, called Dryads, 'whose age is coeval with the
trees they live in: and Dionysus the mirth-giving does he not
increase the yield of the trees, the sacred splendour of Autumn,'
as Pindar says?<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a
href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> And if they care
about all this, is there no god or genius who is interested in the
nurture and growth of boys and youths in all their glorious flower?
is there no one that cares that <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>the growing man may be upright
and virtuous, and that the nobility of his nature may not be warped
and corrupted, either through want of a guardian or by the
depravity of those he associates with? Is it not monstrous and
thankless to say so, seeing that we enjoy the divine bounty, which
is dealt out to us richly, and never abandons us in our straits?
And yet some of these same straits have more necessity than beauty.
For example, our birth, in spite of the unpleasant circumstances
attending it, is witnessed by the divine Ilithyia and Artemis: and
it would be better not to be born at all than to become bad through
want of a good guardian and guide. Moreover in sickness the god who
is over that province does not desert us, nor even in death: for
even then there is a conductor and guide for the departed, to lay
them to sleep, and convey their souls to Hades,<a name=
"FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> as the poet says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Night bore me not to be lord
of the lyre,</span> <span class="i0">Nor to be seer, or healer of
diseases,</span> <span class="i0">But to conduct the souls of the
departed.'</span></div>
</div>

<p>And yet these duties involve much unpleasantness, whereas we
cannot mention a holier work, nor any struggle or contest more
fitting for a god to attend and play the umpire in, than the
guidance of the young and beautiful in the prosecution of their
love-affairs. For there is here nothing of an unpleasant nature, no
compulsion of any kind, but persuasion and grace, truly making toil
sweet and labour delightful, lead the way to virtue and friendship,
and do not arrive at that desired goal without the deity, for they
have as their leader and lord no other god than Love, the companion
of the Muses and Graces and Aphrodite. For Love 'sowing in the
heart of man the sweet harvest of desire,' to borrow the language
of Melanippides, mixes the sweetest and most beautiful things
together. But perhaps you are of a different opinion,
Zeuxippus."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> "Not I, by Zeus," replied
Zeuxippus. "To have a different opinion would be ridiculous."
"Then," continued my father, "is it not also ridiculous, if there
are four kinds of friendship, for so the ancients distinguished,
the natural first, the second that to one's kindred, the third
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id=
"Page_47">47</a></span>that to one's companions, the fourth the
friendship of love, and each of the first three have a god as
patron, either a god of friendship, or a god of hospitality, or a
god of the family, or a god of the race,<a name="FNanchor_101_101"
id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class=
"fnanchor">101</a> whereas the friendship of love only, as
something altogether unholy, is left without any patron god, and
that, too, when it needs most of all attentive direction?" "It is,"
said Zeuxippus, "highly ridiculous." My father continued, "The
language of Plato is very suggestive here, to make a slight
digression. One kind of madness (he says) is conveyed to the soul
from the body through certain bad temperaments or mixtures, or
through the prevalence of some noxious spirit, and is harsh,
difficult to cure, and baneful. Another kind of madness is not
uninspired or from within, but an afflatus from without, a
deviation from sober reason, originated and set in motion by some
higher power, the ordinary characteristic of which is called
enthusiasm. For, as one full of breath is called
&#7956;&mu;&tau;&nu;&omicron;&omicron;&sigmaf;, and as one full of
sense is called &#7956;&mu;&phi;&rho;&omega;&nu;, so the name
enthusiasm is given to the commotion of the soul caused by some
Divine agency.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id=
"FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class=
"fnanchor">102</a> Thus there is the prophetic enthusiasm which
proceeds from Apollo, and the Bacchic enthusiasm which comes from
Dionysus, to which Sophocles alludes where he says, 'Dance with the
Corybantes;' for the rites of Cybele and Pan have great affinities
to the orgies of Bacchus. And the third madness proceeds from the
Muses, and possesses an impressionable and pure soul, and stirs up
the poetry and music in a man. As to the martial and warlike
madness, it is well known from what god it proceeds, namely, Ares,
'kindling tearful war, that puts an end to the dance and the song,
and exciting civic strife.'<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id=
"FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class=
"fnanchor">103</a> There remains, Daphn&aelig;us, one more kind of
madness in man, neither obscure nor tranquil, as to which I should
like to ask Pemptides here,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'What god it is that shakes

</div>

<p>I refer to that love-fury for modest boys and chaste women,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id=
"Page_48">48</a></span>which is far the keenest and fiercest
passion of all. For have you not observed how the soldier, when he
lays aside his arms, ceases from his warlike fury, as the poet
says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i11">'Then from him</span> <span

"FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> The Bacchic and
Corybantic dances one can also modulate and quell, by changing the
metre from the trochaic and the measure from the Phrygian.
Similarly, too, the Pythian priestess, when she descends from her
tripod, possesses her soul in peace. Whereas the love-fury, when
once it has really seized on a man and inflamed him, can be laid by
no Muse, no charm or incantation, no change of place; but present
they burn, absent they desire, by day they follow their loves
about, by night they serenade them, sober call for them, and
drunken sing about them. And he who said that poetic fancies, owing
to their vividness, were dreams of people awake, would have more
truly spoken so of the fancies of lovers, who, as if their loves
were present, converse with them, greet them, chide them. For sight
seems to paint all other fancies on a wet ground, so soon do they
fade and recede from the memory, but the images of lovers, painted
by the fancy as it were on encaustic tiles, leave impressions on
the memory, that move, and live, and speak, and are permanent for
all time. The Roman Cato, indeed, said that the soul of the lover
resided in the soul of the loved one, and I should extend the
remark to the appearance, the character, the life, and the actions,
conducted by which he travels a long journey in a short time, as
the Cynics say they have found a short cut and, as it were, forced
march to virtue, for there is also a short cut to friendship and
love when the god is propitious. To sum up, the enthusiasm of
lovers is not a thing uninspired, and the god that guides and
governs it is none other than the god whose festival we are now
keeping, and to whom we are now sacrificing. Nevertheless, as we
judge of a god mainly from his power and usefulness (as among human
advantages we reckon and call these two the most divine, <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id=
"Page_49">49</a></span>dominion and virtue), it is high time to
consider, before we proceed any further, whether Love yields to any
of the gods in power. Certainly, as Sophocles says, 'Wonderful is
the power which the Cyprian Queen exerts so as always to win the
victory:'<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a
href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> great also is the
might of Ares; and in some sort we see the power of all the other
gods divided among these two; for Aphrodite has most intimate
connection with the beautiful, and Ares is in our souls from the
first to combat against the sordid, to borrow the idea of Plato.
Let us consider, then, to begin with, that the venereal delight can
be purchased for six obols, and that no one ever yet put himself
into any trouble or danger about it, unless he was in love. And not
to mention here such famous courtesans as Phryne or Lais,
Gnath&aelig;nium, 'kindling her lamp at evening time,' on the
look-out for lovers and inviting them, is often passed by; 'yet, if
some sudden whiff arise' of mighty love and desire, it makes this
very delight seem equal to the fabled wealth of Tantalus and his
domains. So feeble and cloying is the venereal indulgence, if Love
inspires it not. And you will see this more plainly still from the
following consideration. Many have allowed others to share in their
venereal enjoyments, prostituting not only their mistresses but
their wives, like that Roman Galba, who used to ask M&aelig;cenas
to dinner, and when he saw from his nods and winks that he had a
mind to do with his wife, turned his head gently aside as if
asleep; but when one of his slaves came up to the table and stole
some wine, his eyes were wide open enough, and he said, 'Villain,
don't you know that I am asleep only for M&aelig;cenas?'<a name=
"FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> But this is not
perhaps so strange, considering Galba was a buffoon. But at Argos
Nicostratus and Phayllus were great political rivals: so when King
Philip visited that city, Phayllus thought if he prostituted his
wife, who was very handsome, to the King, he would get from him
some important office or place. And Nicostratus getting wind of
this, and walking about the doors of Phayllus' house with some of
his servants on the <i>qui vive</i>, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>Phayllus made his wife put on
men's boots, and a military cloak, and a Macedonian broad-brimmed
hat, and so smuggled her into the King, without being detected, as
one of the King's young men. But, of all the multitude of lovers,
did you ever hear of one that prostituted his boy-love even for the
honours of Zeus? I think not. Why, though no one will generally
either speak or act against tyrants, many will who find them their
rivals and are jealous about their handsome minions. You must have
heard how Aristogiton of Athens, and Antileon of Metapontum, and
Melanippus of Agrigentum, rose not against tyrants, although they
saw how badly they managed affairs, and what drunken tricks they
played, yet, when they attempted the chastity of their boy-loves,
they retaliated on them, jeoparding their lives, as if they were
defending the inviolability of temples and sanctuaries. It is also
recorded that Alexander wrote to Theodoras, the brother of Proteas,
'Send me your singing-girl, unless you love her yourself, and I
will give you ten talents;' and when Antipatridas, one of his
companions, came to revel with him, bringing with him a female
harper, he fancied the girl not a little, and asked Antipatridas if
he cared very much about her. And when he replied that he did
immensely, Alexander said, 'Plague take you,' but nevertheless
abstained from touching the girl.</p>

and those near him, "but we should very much like to." "Well," said
my father, "the tale's worth hearing. When the war between the
Eretrians and Chalcidians was at its height, Cleomachus had come to
aid the latter with a Thessalian force; and the Chalcidian infantry
seemed strong enough, but they had great difficulty in repelling
the enemy's cavalry. So they begged that high-souled hero
Cleomachus to charge the Eretrian cavalry first. And he asked his
boy-love, who was by, if he would be a spectator of the fight, and
he saying he would, and affectionately kissing him and putting his
helmet on his head, Cleomachus with a proud joy put himself at the
head of the bravest of the Thessalians, and charged the enemy's
cavalry with such impetuosity that he threw them into disorder and
routed them; and the Eretrian infantry also fleeing in consequence,
the Chalcidians won a splendid victory. However, Cleomachus got
killed, and they show his tomb in the market-place at Chalcis, over
which a huge pillar stands to this day, and whereas before that the
people of Chalcis had censured boy-loves, from that time forward
they preferred that kind of love to the normal love. Aristotle
gives a slightly different account, namely, that this Cleomachus
came not from Thessaly, but from Chalcis in Thrace, to the help of
the Chalcidians in Eub&oelig;a; and that that was the origin of the
song in vogue among the Chalcidians,</p>

men? And did not the erotic Pammenes change the disposition of the
heavy-armed infantry, censuring Homer as knowing nothing about

leave in the lurch clansmen and friends, aye, and parents and sons,
but what warrior ever broke through or charged through lover and
love, seeing that even when there is no necessity lovers frequently
display their bravery and contempt of life. As Thero the
Thessalian, who put his left hand on a wall, and drew his sword,
and chopped off his thumb, and challenged his rival to do the same.
And another in battle falling on his face, as his enemy was about
to give him the <i>coup-de-grace</i>, begged him to wait a little
till he could turn round, that his love should not see him with a
wound in his back. And not only are the most warlike nations most
amorous, as the B&oelig;otians the Laced&aelig;monians and the
Cretans, but also of the old heroes, who were more amorous than
Meleager, Achilles, Aristomenes, Cimon, and Epaminondas. Why,
Epaminondas had as his boy-loves Asopichus and Cephisodorus, the
latter of whom fell with him at Mantinea, and is buried near him.
As to ..., who was most formidable and a source of terror to the
enemy, Eucnamus of Amphissa, who first stood up against him and
smote him, received hero honours from the Phocians for his exploit.
And as to all the loves of Hercules, it would take up too much time
to enumerate them, but those who think that Iolaus was one of them
do up to this day worship and honour him, and make their loves
swear fidelity at his tomb. Hercules is also said, having
understood the art of healing, to have preserved the life of
Alcestis, when she was given up by the doctors, to gratify Admetus,
who passionately loved his wife, and was Hercules' minion. They say

women have not much of Ares in them, yet when possessed by Love
they are bold even to the death, beyond what one would expect from

show that the only one of the gods that Hades pays attention to is
Love; although to everybody else, as Sophocles says, "he knows of
no forbearance or favour, or anything but strict justice; "yet
before lovers his genius stands rebuked, and they alone find him
neither implacable nor relentless. Wherefore although, my friend,

altogether believes nor altogether disbelieves. For legendary lore
speaks well, and by a certain wonderful good fortune lights upon
the truth, in saying that lovers have a return from Hades to the
light of day, but it knows not by what way or how, having as it
were got benighted on the road which Plato first discovered by
philosophy. There are, indeed, some slender and obscure particles
of truth scattered about in the mythology of the Egyptians, but
they require a clever man to hunt them out, a man capable of
getting great results from small data. Wherefore let that matter
pass. And now next to the mighty power of Love let us consider its
good will and favour to mankind, I do not mean as to whether it
bestows many gifts on its votaries&mdash;that is palpable to
all&mdash;but whether they derive any further advantage from it.

<p>For it makes one previously sluggish quick and intelligent, and,
as has been said before, it makes the coward brave, as people
harden wood in the fire and make it strong from being weak. And
every lover becomes liberal and genuine <span class='pagenum'><a

was mean before, his littleness and miserliness melting away like
iron in the fire, so that they rejoice to give to their loves more
than they do to receive themselves from others. You know of course
that Anytus, the son of Anthemion, was in love with Alcibiades, and
was on one occasion sumptuously entertaining several of his
friends, when Alcibiades broke in and took from the table half the
cups and went away again; and when some of the guests were
indignant and said, 'The stripling has used you most insolently and
contemptuously,' Anytus replied, 'Nay, rather, he has dealt kindly
with me, for when he might have taken all he has left me
half.'"</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xviii.</span> Zeuxippus was pleased
with this story, and said, "O Hercules, you have been within an ace
of making me forget my hereditary hatred to Anytus for his
behaviour to Socrates and philosophy,<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id=
"FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class=

it so," said my father, "Love also makes peevish and gloomy persons
kind and agreeable to those they live with; for as 'when the fire
blazes the house looks brighter,'<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id=
"FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class=
"fnanchor">117</a> so man, it seems, becomes more cheerful through
the heat of love. But most people are affected rather curiously; if
they see by night a light in a house, they look on it with
admiration and wonder; but if they see a little, mean, and ignoble
soul suddenly filled with noble-mindedness, freedom, dignity,
grace, and liberality, they do not feel constrained to say with
Telemachus, 'Surely, some god is there within.'<a name=
"FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> And is it not
wonderful, Daphn&aelig;us," continued my father,<a name=
"FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> "in the name of the
Graces, that the lover who cares about hardly anything, either his
companions and friends, or even the laws and magistrates and kings,
who fears nothing, admires nothing, courts nothing, but can even
endure to gaze on 'the forked lightning,'<a name="FNanchor_120_120"
id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class=

like a cock with drooping feathers,' and his boldness is <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>broken
and his pride is cowed. And among the Muses it would not be amiss
to mention Sappho; for as the Romans say Cacus the son of
Heph&aelig;stus vomited out of his mouth fire and flames, so she
really speaks words that burn like fire, and in her songs shows the
warmth of her heart, as Philoxenus puts it, 'by euphonious songs
assuaging the pains of love.' And if you have not in your love for
Lysandra forgot all your old love-songs, do repeat to us,
Daphn&aelig;us, the lines in which beautiful Sappho says that 'when
her love appeared her voice failed and her body burned, and she was
seized with paleness and trembling and vertigo.'" And when
Daphn&aelig;us had repeated the lines, my father resumed, "In the
name of Zeus, is not this plainly a divine seizure? Is not this a
wonderful commotion of soul? Why, the Pythian priestess on the
tripod is not moved so much as this! Who of those inspired by
Cybele are made beside themselves to this extent by the flute and
the kettledrum? Moreover, while many see the same body and the same
beauty, only the lover is taken by it. Why is this the case? We get
no light on it from Menander's words, 'Love is opportunity; and he
that is smitten is the only one wounded.' But the god is the cause
of it, striking one and letting another go scot-free. But I will
not pass over now, 'since it has come into my mouth,' as
&AElig;schylus says, what perhaps would have been better spoken
before, for it is a very important point. Perhaps, my friend, of
all other things which we do not perceive through the senses, some
got believed through legend, some through the law, some through
reason; whereas we owe our conception of the gods altogether to the
poets and legislators and philosophers: all alike teaching the
existence of gods, but greatly differing as to their number and
order, nature and power. For the gods of the philosophers 'know
nothing of disease or old age or pain, and have not to cross the
resounding Acheron;' nor do the philosophers accept as gods
Strifes, or Prayers, which are found in poetry;<a name=
"FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> nor will they admit
Terror and Fear as gods or as the sons of Ares. And on many points
also they are at variance with the legislators, as Xenophanes bade
the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id=
"Page_56">56</a></span>Egyptians, if they regarded Osiris as
mortal, not to honour him as a god; but if they thought him a god
not to mourn for him. And, again, the poets and legislators will
not listen to, nor can they understand, the philosophers who make
gods of ideas and numbers and units and spirits. And their views
generally are very different. As there were formerly three parties
at Athens, the Parali, the Epacrii, and the Pediei, all at variance
with one another, yet all agreed to vote for Solon, and chose him
with one accord as their mediator and ruler and lawgiver, as he
seemed indisputably to hold the first place in merit; so the three
parties that entertain different views about the gods are all
unanimous on one point, for poets legislators and philosophers all
alike register Love as one of the gods, 'loudly singing his praises
with one voice,' as Alc&aelig;us says the people of Mitylene chose
Pittacus as their monarch. But our king and ruler and governor,
Love, is brought down crowned from Helicon to the Academy by Hesiod
and Plato and Solon, and in royal apparel rides in a chariot drawn
by friendship and intimacy (not such as Euripides speaks of in the
line, 'he has been bound in fetters not of brass,'<a name=
"FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> shamefully throwing
round him cold and heavy necessity), and soars aloft to the most
beautiful and divine things, about which others have spoken better
than I can."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xix.</span> When my father had spoken
thus much, Soclarus began, "Do you see that a second time you have
committed the same fault, not cancelling your debts as you ought to
do&mdash;for I must speak my mind&mdash;but evading them on
purpose, and not delivering to us your promised ideas on a sacred
subject? For as some little time back you only just touched on
Plato and the Egyptians as if unwilling to enter on the subject
more fully, so now you are doing again. However, as to what has
been 'eloquently told'<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id=
"FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class=
"fnanchor">123</a> by Plato, or rather by the Muses through Plato's
mouth, do not tell us that, my good friend, even if we ask for it;
but as to your hint that the Egyptian legend about Love
corresponded with Plato's views, you need not discuss it fully and
minutely, we shall be satisfied if we hear a little of <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>such mighty
matters." And as the rest of the company made the same request, my
father said, "The Egyptians, (like the Greeks) recognize two Loves,
the Pandemian and the Celestial, to which they add the Sun, they
also highly venerate Aphrodite. We also see much similarity between
Love and the Sun, for neither is a fire, as some think, but a sweet
and productive radiance and warmth, the Sun bringing to the body
nourishment and light and growth, and Love doing the same to the
soul. And as the heat of the Sun is more powerful when it emerges
from clouds and after mist, so Love is sweeter and hotter after a
jealous tiff with the loved one,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id=
"FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class=
"fnanchor">124</a> and moreover, as some think the Sun is kindled
and extinguished, so also do people conceive of Love as mortal and
uncertain. Moreover, just as without training the body cannot
easily bear the heat of the Sun, so neither can the untrained soul
easily bear the yoke of Love, but both are equally out of tune and
suffer, for which they blame the deity and not their own weakness.
But in this respect they seem to differ, in that the Sun exhibits
to the eye things beautiful and ugly alike, whereas Love throws its
light only on beautiful things, and persuades lovers to concentrate
their attention on these, and to neglect all other things. As to
those that call Aphrodite the Moon, they, too, find some points in
common between them; for the Moon is divine and heavenly and a sort
of halfway-house between mortal and immortal, but inactive in
itself and dark without the presence of the Sun, as is the case
with Aphrodite in the absence of Love. So we may say that Aphrodite
resembles the Moon, and Love the Sun, more than any other deities,
yet are not Love and the Sun altogether the same, for just as body
and soul are not the same, but something different, so is it with
the Sun and Love, the former can be seen, the latter only felt. And
if it should not seem too harsh a saying, one might argue that the
Sun acts entirely opposite to Love, for it turns the mind away from
the world of fancy to the world of reality, beguiling us by its
grace and splendid appearance, and persuading us to seek for truth
and everything else in and round it and nowhere else. For as
Euripides says,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id=
"Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Too passionately do we love
the Sun,</span> <span class="i0">Because it always shines upon the
earth,</span> <span class="i0">From inexperience of another
life,'<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>or rather from forgetfulness of those things which Love brings
to our remembrance. For as when we are woke by a great and bright
light, everything that the soul has seen in dreams is vanished and
fled, so the Sun is wont to banish the remembrance of past changes
and chances, and to bewitch the intelligence, pleasure and
admiration causing this forgetfulness. And though reality is really
there, yet the soul cleaves to dreams and is dazzled by what is
most beautiful and divine. 'For round the soul are poured sweet yet
deceiving dreams,' so that the soul thinks everything here good and
valuable, unless it obtain divine and chaste Love as its physician
and preserver. For Love brings the soul through the body to truth
and the region of truth, where pure and guileless beauty is to be
found, kindly befriending its votaries like an initiator at the
mysteries. And it associates with the soul only through the body.
And as geometricians, in the case of boys who cannot yet be
initiated into the perception of incorporeal and impassive
substance, convey their ideas through the medium of spheres, cubes,
and dodecahedrons, so celestial Love has contrived beautiful
mirrors of beautiful things, and exhibits them to us glittering in
the shapes colours and appearances of youths in all their flower,
and calmly stirs the memory which is inflamed first by these.
Consequently some, through the stupidity of their friends and
intimates, who have endeavoured by force and against reason to
extinguish the flame, have got no advantage from it, but filled
themselves with smoke and confusion, or have rushed into secret and
lawless pleasures and ingloriously wasted their prime. But as many
as by sober reason and modesty have abated the extravagance of the
passion, and left in the soul only a bright glow&mdash;not exciting
a tornado of passion, but a wonderful and productive diffusion, as
in a growing plant, opening the pores of complaisance and
friendliness&mdash;these in no long time cease to regard the
personal charms of those they love, and study their inward <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id=
"Page_59">59</a></span>characters, and gaze at one another with
unveiled eyes, and associate with one another in words and actions,
if they find in their minds any fragment or image of the beautiful;
and if not they bid them farewell and turn to others, like bees
that only go to those flowers from which they can get honey. But
wherever they find any trace or emanation or pleasing resemblance
of the divine, in an ecstasy of pleasure and delight they indulge
their memory, and revive to whatever is truly lovely and felicitous
and admired by everybody."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xx.</span> "The poets indeed seem for
the most part to have written and sung about Love in a playful and
merry manner, but have sometimes spoken seriously about him,
whether out of their own mind, or the god helping them to truth.
Among these are the lines about his birth, 'Well-sandalled Iris
bare the most powerful of the gods to golden-haired Zephyr.'<a
name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> But perhaps the
learned have persuaded you that these lines are only a fanciful
illustration of the variety and beauty of love." "Certainly," said
Daphn&aelig;us, "what else could they mean?" "Hear me," said my
father, "for the heavenly phenomenon compels us so to speak. The
rainbow<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a
href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> is, I suppose, a
reflection caused by the sun's rays falling on a moist cloud,
making us think the appearance is in the cloud. Similarly erotic
fancy in the case of noble souls causes a reflection of the memory,
from things which here appear and are called beautiful, to what is
really divine and lovely and felicitous and wonderful. But most
lovers pursuing and groping after the semblance of beauty in boys
and women, as in mirrors,<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id=
"FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class=
"fnanchor">128</a> can derive nothing more certain than pleasure
mixed with pain. And this seems the love-delirium of Ixion, who
instead of the joy he desired embraced only a cloud, as children
who desire to take the rainbow into their hands, clutching at
whatever they see. But different is the be<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>haviour of the noble and
chaste lover: for he reflects on the divine beauty that can only be
felt, while he uses the beauty of the visible body only as an organ
of the memory, though he embraces it and loves it, and associating
with it is still more inflamed in mind. And so neither in the body
do they sit ever gazing at and desiring this light, nor after death
do they return to this world again, and skulk and loiter about the
doors and bedchambers of newly-married people, disagreeable ghosts
of pleasure-loving and sensual men and women, who do not rightly
deserve the name of lovers. For the true lover, when he has got
into the other world and associated with beauties as much as is
lawful, has wings and is initiated and passes his time above in the
presence of his Deity, dancing and waiting upon him, until he goes
back to the meadows of the Moon and Aphrodite, and sleeping there
commences a new existence. But this is a subject too high for the
present occasion. However, it is with Love as with the other gods,
to borrow the words of Euripides, 'he rejoices in being honoured by
mankind,'<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a
href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> and <i>vice
versa</i>, for he is most propitious to those that receive him
properly, but visits his displeasure on those that affront him. For
neither does Zeus as god of Hospitality punish and avenge any
outrages on strangers or suppliants, nor as god of the family
fulfil the curses of parents, as quickly as Love hearkens to lovers
unfairly treated, being the chastiser of boorish and haughty
persons. Why need I mention the story of Euxynthetus and
Leucomantis, the latter of whom is called The Peeping Girl to this
day in Cyprus? But perhaps you have not heard of the punishment of
the Cretan Gorgo, a somewhat similar case to that of Leucomantis,
except that she was turned into stone as she peeped out of window
to see her lover carried out to burial. For this Gorgo had a lover
called Asander, a proper young man and of a good family, but
reduced in fortune, though he thought himself worthy to mate with
anybody. So he wooed Gorgo, being a relation of hers, and though he
had many rivals, as she was much run after for her wealth belike,
yet he had won the esteem of all the guardians and relations of the
young girl.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a

(just as a neat shoe exhibits the shapeliness of the foot, to

appropriate answer as to his erotic desires, shall the noble lover
of beauty neglect beauty and nobility of nature, and make love only

humanity be unfair and deal unequally with either sex, and think
that the difference between the loves of boys and women is only
their different dress? And yet they say that beauty is a flower of
virtue; and it is ridiculous to assert that the female sex never
blossoms nor make a goodly show of virtue, for as &AElig;schylus
truly says,</p>

and shall there be no gleam of chastity and modesty in their
appearance? Nay, there are many such, and shall they not move and
provoke love? To doubt it would be neither sensible nor in
accordance with the facts, for generally speaking, as has been
pointed out, all these attractions are the same in both sexes....
But, Daphn&aelig;us, let us combat those views which Zeuxippus
lately advanced, making Love to be only irregular desire carrying
the soul away to licentiousness, not that this was so much his own
view as what he had often heard from morose men who knew nothing of
love: some of whom marry unfortunate women for their dowries, and
force on them economy and illiberal saving, and quarrel with them
every day of their lives: while others, more desirous of children
than wives, when they have made those women they come across
mothers, bid farewell to marriage, or regard it not at all, and
neither care to love nor be loved. Now the fact that the word for
conjugal love differs only by one letter from the word for
endurance, the one being
&sigma;&tau;&#8051;&rho;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&nu; the other
&sigma;&tau;&#8051;&gamma;&epsilon;&iota;&nu;, seems to emphasize
the conjugal kindness mixed by time and intimacy with necessity.
But that marriage which Love has inspired will in the first place,
as in Plato's Republic, know nothing of <i>Meum</i> and
<i>Tuum</i>, for the proverb, 'whatever belongs to a friend is
common property,'<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id=
"FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class=
"fnanchor">137</a> is especially true of married persons who,
though disunited in body, are perforce one in soul, neither wishing
to be two, nor thinking themselves so. In the second place there
will be mutual respect, which is a vital necessity in marriage. For
as to that external respect which has in it more of compulsion than
choice, being forced by the law and shame and fear,</p>

<p>that will always exist in wedlock. But in Love there is such
self-control and decorum and constancy, that if the god but once
enter the soul of a licentious man, he makes him give up all his
amours, abates his pride, and breaks down his haughtiness and
dissoluteness, putting in their place modesty and silence and
tranquillity and decorum, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63"

heard of course of the famous courtesan Lais,<a name=

army, and went off to Thessaly and lived faithful to Hippolochus.
But the women there, envious and jealous of her for her surpassing
beauty, dragged her into the temple of Aphrodite, and there stoned
her to death, for which reason probably it is called to this day
the temple of Aphrodite the Murderess.<a name="FNanchor_142_142"

who have scorned an amour with queens, when Love has had dominion
in their hearts. For as in Rome, when a dictator is proclaimed, all
other magistrates lay down their offices, so those over whom Love
is lord are free henceforward from all other lords and masters, and
pass the rest of their lives dedicate to the god and slaves in his

of the goddess, and pledged him in a cup of poisoned mead, drinking
half of it herself and giving him the rest. And when she saw that
he had drunk it up, she shouted aloud for joy, and calling upon the
name of her dead husband, said, 'Till this day, dearest husband, I
have lived, deprived of you, a life of sorrow: but now take me to
yourself with joy, for I have avenged you on the worst of men, as
glad to share death with him as life with you.' Then Sinorix was
removed out of the temple on a litter, and soon after gave up the

examples might be adduced, both among ourselves and foreigners, who
can feel any patience with those that reproach Aphrodite with
hindering friendship when she associates herself with Love as a
partner? Whereas any reflecting person would call the love of boys
wanton and gross lasciviousness, and say with the poet:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'This is an outrage, not an
act of love.'</span></div>
</div>

<p>All willing pathics, therefore, we consider the vilest of
mankind, and credit them with neither fidelity, nor modesty, nor
friendship, for as Sophocles says:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Those who shall lose such
friends may well be glad,</span> <span class="i0">And those who
have such pray that they may lose them,'<a name="FNanchor_145_145"

<p>But as for those who, not being by nature vicious, have been
seduced or forced, they are apt all their life to despise and hate
their seducers, and when an opportunity has presented itself to
take fierce vengeance. As Crateus, who murdered Archelaus, and
Pytholaus, who murdered <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id=
"Page_65">65</a></span>Alexander of Pher&aelig;. And Periander, the
tyrant of the Ambraciotes, having asked a most insulting question
of his minion, was murdered by him, so exasperated was he. But with
women and wives all this is the beginning of friendship, and as it
were an initiation into the sacred mysteries. And pleasure plays a
very small part in this, but the esteem and favour and mutual love
and constancy that result from it, proves that the Delphians did
not talk nonsense in giving the name of Arma<a name=
"FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> to Aphrodite, nor
Homer in giving the name of friendship<a name="FNanchor_147_147"
id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class=
"fnanchor">147</a> to sexual love, and testifies to the fact that
Solon was a most experienced legislator in conjugal matters, seeing
that he ordered husbands not less than thrice a month to associate
with their wives, not for pleasure, but as states at certain
intervals renew their treaties with one another, so he wished that
by such friendliness marriage should, as it were, be renewed after
any intervening tiffs and differences. But you will tell me there
is much folly and even madness in the love of women. Is there not
more extravagance in the love of boys?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'Seeing my many rivals I grow
faint.</span> <span class="i0">The lad is beardless, smooth and
soft and handsome,</span> <span class="i0">O that I might in his
embraces die,</span> <span class="i0">And have the fact recorded on
my tomb.'</span></div>
</div>

<p>Such extravagant language as this is madness not love. And it is
absurd to detract from woman's various excellence. Look at their
self-restraint and intelligence, their fidelity and uprightness,
and that bravery courage and magnanimity so conspicuous in many!
And to say that they have a natural aptitude for all other virtues,
but are deficient as regards friendship alone, is monstrous. For
they are fond of their children and husbands, and generally
speaking the natural affection in them is not only, like a fruitful
soil, capable of friendship, but is also accompanied by persuasion
and other graces. And as poetry gives to words a kind of relish by
melody and metre and rhythm, making instruction thereby more
interesting, but what is injurious more insidious, so nature, <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id=
"Page_66">66</a></span>investing woman with beautiful appearance
and attractive voice and bewitching figure, does much for a
licentious woman in making her wiles more formidable, but makes a
modest one more apt thereby to win the goodwill and friendship of
her husband. And as Plato advised Xenocrates, a great and noble man
in all other respects, but too austere in his temperament, to
sacrifice to the Graces, so one might recommend a good and modest
woman to sacrifice to Love, that her husband might be a mild and
agreeable partner, and not run after any other woman, so as to be
compelled to say like the fellow in the comedy, 'What a wretch I am
to ill-treat such a woman!' For to love in marriage is far better
than to be loved, for it prevents many, nay all, of those offences
which spoil and mar marriage.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxiv.</span> As to the passionate
affection in the early days of marriage,<a name="FNanchor_148_148"
id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class=
"fnanchor">148</a> my dear Zeuxippus, do not fear that it will
leave any sore or irritation, though it is not wonderful that there
should be some friction at the commencement of union with a
virtuous woman, just as at the grafting of trees, as there is also
pain at the beginning of conception, for there can be no complete
union without some suffering. Learning puts boys out somewhat when
they first go to school, as philosophy does young men at a later
day, but the ill effects are not lasting, either in their cases or
in the case of lovers. As in the fusion of two liquors, love does
indeed at first cause a simmering and commotion, but eventually
cools down and settles and becomes tranquil. For the union of
lovers is indeed a complete union, whereas the union of those that
live together without love resembles only the friction and
concussion of Epicurus' atoms in collision and recoil, forming no
such union as Love makes, when he presides over the conjugal state.
For nothing else produces so much pleasure, or such lasting
advantages, or such beautiful remarkable and desirable
friendship,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">'As when husband and wife live
in one house,</span> <span class="i0">Two souls beating as one.'<a

</div>

<p>And the law gives its countenance, and nature shows that <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>even
the gods themselves require love for the production of everything.
Thus the poets tell us that 'the earth loves a shower, and heaven
loves the earth,' and the natural philosophers tell us that the sun
is in love with the moon, and that they are husband and wife, and
that the earth is the mother of man and beast and the producer of
all plants. Would not the world itself then of necessity come to an
end, if the great god Love and the desires implanted by the god
should leave matter, and matter should cease to yearn for and
pursue its lead? But not to seem to wander too far away and
altogether to trifle, you know that many censure boy-loves for
their instability, and jeeringly say that that intimacy like an egg
is destroyed by a hair,<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id=
"FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class=
"fnanchor">150</a> for that boy-lovers like Nomads, spending the
summer in a blooming and flowery country, at once decamp then as
from an enemy's territory. And still more vulgarly Bion the Sophist
called the sprouting beards of beautiful boys Harmodiuses and
Aristogitons,<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id=
"FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class=
"fnanchor">151</a> inasmuch as lovers were delivered by them from a
pleasant tyranny. But this charge cannot justly be brought against
genuine lovers, and it was prettily said by Euripides, as he
embraced and kissed handsome Agatho whose beard was just sprouting,
that the Autumn of beautiful youths was lovely as well as the
Spring. And I maintain that the love of beautiful and chaste wives
flourishes not only in old age amid grey hairs and wrinkles, but
even in the grave and monument. And while there are few such long
unions in the case of boy-loves, one might enumerate ten thousand
such instances of the love of women, who have kept their fidelity
to the end of their lives. One such case I will relate, which
happened in my time in the reign of the Emperor Vespasian.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxv.</span> Julius, who stirred up a
revolt in Galatia, among several other confederates had one
Sabinus, a young man of good family, and for wealth and renown the
most conspicuous of all the men in those parts. But having
attempted <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id=
"Page_68">68</a></span>what was too much for them they were foiled,
and expecting to pay the penalty, some committed suicide, others
fled and were captured. Now Sabinus himself could easily have got
out of the way and made his escape to the barbarians, but he had
married a most excellent wife, whose name in that part of the world
was Empone, but in Greek would be Herois, and he could neither
leave her behind nor take her with him. As he had in the country
some underground caves, known only to two of his freedmen, where he
used to stow away things, he dismissed all the rest of his slaves,
as if he intended to poison himself, and taking with him these two
trusty freedmen he descended with them into those underground
caves, and sent one of them, Martialis, to tell his wife that he
had poisoned himself, and that his body was burnt in the flames of
his country-house, for he wanted his wife's genuine sorrow to lend
credit to the report of his death. And so it happened. For she,
throwing herself on to the ground, groaned and wailed for three
days and nights, and took no food. And Sabinus, being informed of
this, and fearing that she would die of grief, told Martialis to
inform her secretly that he was alive and well and in hiding, and
to beg her not to relax her show of grief, but to keep up the
farce. And she did so with the genius of a professional actress,
but yearning to see her husband she visited him by night, and
returned without being noticed, and for six or seven months she
lived with him this underground life. And she disguised him by
changing his dress, and cutting off his beard, and re-arranging his
hair, so that he should not be known, and took him to Rome, having
some hopes of obtaining his pardon. But being unsuccessful in this
she returned to her own country, and spent most of her time with
her husband underground, but from time to time visited the town,
and showed herself to some ladies who were her friends and
relations. But what is most astonishing of all is that, though she
bathed with them, she concealed her pregnancy from them. For the
dye which women use to make their hair a golden auburn, has a
tendency to produce corpulence and flesh and a full habit, and she
rubbed this abundantly over all parts of her body, and so concealed
her pregnancy. And she bare the pangs of travail by herself, as a
lioness bears her whelps, having hid herself in the cave with
her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id=
"Page_69">69</a></span> husband, and there she gave birth to two
boys, one of whom died in Egypt, the other, whose name was Sabinus,
was among us only the other day at Delphi. Vespasian eventually put
her to death, but paid the penalty for it, his whole progeny in a
short time being wiped off the face of the earth.<a name=
"FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> For during the whole
of his reign he did no more savage act, nor could gods or demons
have turned away their eyes from a crueller sight. And yet her
courage and bold language abated the pity of the spectators, though
it exasperated Vespasian, for, despairing of her safety, she bade
them go and tell the Emperor, 'that it was sweeter to live in
darkness and underground than to wear his crown.'"<a name=

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxvi.</span> Here my father said that
the conversation about Love which took place at Thespi&aelig;
ended. And at this moment Diogenes, one of Pisias' companions, was
noticed coming up at a faster pace than walking. And while he was
yet a little way off, Soclarus hailed him with, "You don't announce
war, Diogenes," and he replied, "Hush! it is a marriage; come with
me quickly, for the sacrifice only waits for you." All were
delighted, and Zeuxippus asked if Pisias was still against the
marriage. "As he was first to oppose it," said Diogenes, "so he was
first to yield the victory to Ismenodora, and he has now put on a
crown and robed himself in white, so as to take his place at the
head of the procession to the god through the market-place."
"Come," said my father, "in Heaven's name, let us go and laugh at
him, and worship the god; for it is clear that the god has taken
delight in what has happened, and been propitious."</p>

<h3>CONJUGAL PRECEPTS.</h3>

<h4>PLUTARCH SENDS GREETING TO POLLIANUS AND EURYDICE.</h4>

<p>After the customary marriage rites, by which, the Priestess of
Demeter has united you together, I think that to make an
appropriate discourse, and one that will chime in with the
occasion, will be useful to you and agreeable to the law. For in
music one of the tunes played on the flute is called Hippothorus,<a
name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> which is a tune that
excites fierce desire in stallions to cover mares; and though in
philosophy there are many goodly subjects, yet is there none more
worthy of attention than that of marriage, on which subject
philosophy spreads a charm over those who are to pass life
together, and makes them gentle and mild to one another. I send
therefore as a gift to both of you a summary of what you have often
heard, as you are both well versed in philosophy, arranging my
matter in a series of short observations that it may be the more
easily remembered, and I pray that the Muses will assist and
co-operate with Aphrodite, so that no lyre or lute could be more
harmonious or in tune than your married life, as the result of
philosophy and concord. And thus the ancients set up near Aphrodite
statues of Hermes, to show that conversation was one of the great
charms of marriage, and also statues of Peitho<a name=
"FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> and the Graces, to
teach married people to gain their way with one another by
persuasion, and not by wrangling or contention.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Solon bade the bride eat a
quince the first night of marriage, intimating thereby, it seems,
that the bridegroom, was to expect his first pleasure from the
bride's mouth and conversation.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> In B&oelig;otia they dress
up the bride with a chaplet <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71"
id="Page_71">71</a></span>of asparagus, for as the asparagus gives
most excellent fruit from a thorny stalk, so the bride, by not
being too reluctant and coy in the first approaches, will make the
married state more agreeable and pleasant. But those husbands who
cannot put up with the early peevishness of their brides, are not a
whit wiser than those persons who pluck unripe grapes and leave the
ripe grapes for others.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id=
"FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class=
"fnanchor">156</a> On the other hand, many brides, being at first
disgusted with their husbands, are like those that stand the bee's
sting but neglect the honey.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> Married people should
especially at the outset beware of the first quarrel and collision,
observing that vessels when first fabricated are easily broken up
into their component parts, but in process of time, getting compact
and firmly welded together, are proof against either fire or
steel.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> As fire gets kindled
easily in chaff or in a wick or in the fur of hares, but is easily
extinguished again, if it find no material to keep it in and feed
it, so we must not consider that the love of newly-married people,
that blazes out so fiercely in consequence of the attractions of
youth and beauty, will be durable and lasting, unless it be fixed
in the character, and occupy the mind, and make a living
impression.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a
href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> As catching fish by drugged
bait is easy, but makes the fish poor to eat and insipid, so those
wives that lay traps for their husbands by philtres and charms, and
become their masters by pleasure, have stupid senseless and spoiled
husbands to live with. For those that were bewitched by Circe did
her no good, nor could she make any use of them when they were
turned into swine and asses, but she was greatly in love with the
prudent Odysseus who dwelt with her sensibly.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> Those women who would
rather lord it over fools than obey sensible men, resemble those
people who would rather lead the blind on a road, and not people
who have eyesight and know how to follow.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> Women disbelieve that
Pasiph&auml;e, a king's wife, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>was enamoured of a bull,
although they see some of their sex despising grave and sober men,
and preferring to associate with men who are the slaves of
intemperance and pleasure, and like dogs and he-goats.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> Men who through weakness
or effeminacy cannot vault upon their horses' backs, teach them to
kneel and so receive their riders. Similarly, some men that marry
noble or rich wives, instead of making themselves better humble
their wives, thinking to rule them easier by lowering them. But one
ought to govern with an eye to the merit of a woman, as much as to
the size of a horse.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> We see that the moon when
it is far from the sun is bright and glorious, but pales and hides
its light when it is near. A modest wife on the contrary ought to
be seen chiefly with her husband, and to stay at home and in
retirement in his absence.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> It is not a true
observation of Herodotus, that a woman puts off her modesty with
her shift.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a
href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> On the contrary,
the modest woman puts on her modesty instead, and great modesty is
a sign of great conjugal love.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xi.</span> As where two voices are in
unison the loudest prevails; so in a well-managed household
everything is done by mutual consent, but the husband's supremacy
is exhibited, and his wishes are consulted.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xii.</span> The Sun beat the North
Wind.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> For when it blew a
strong and terrible blast, and tried to make the man remove his
cloak, he only drew it round him more closely, but when the Sun
came out with its warm rays, at first warmed and afterwards
scorched, he stripped himself of coat as well as cloak. Most woman
act similarly: if their husbands try to curtail by force their
luxury and extravagance, they are vexed and fight for their rights,
but if they are convinced by reason, they quietly drop their
expensive habits, and keep within bounds.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> Cato turned out of the
Senate a man who kissed his own wife in the presence of his
daughter. This was perhaps too strong a step, but if it is
unseemly, as indeed it is, for husband and wife in the presence of
others to fondle <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id=
"Page_73">73</a></span>and kiss and embrace one another, is it not
far more unseemly in the presence of others to quarrel and jangle?
Just as conjugal caresses and endearments ought to be private, so
ought admonition and scolding and plain speaking.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> Just as there is little
use in a mirror adorned with gold or precious stones, unless it
conveys a true likeness, so there is no advantage in a rich wife,
unless she conforms her life and habits to her husband's position.
For if when a man is joyful the mirror makes him look sad, and when
he is put out and sad it makes him look gay and smiling from ear to
ear, the mirror is plainly faulty. So the wife is faulty and devoid

of ropes comes from the twining and interlacing of fibres together,

interchange of mutual affection and kindness. Nature itself teaches
this by the birth of children, which are so much a joint result,
that neither husband nor wife can dis<span class='pagenum'><a name=

Socrates, that when young men looked at themselves in the mirror,
those who were not handsome should become so through virtue, and

is it for the matron, when she has the mirror in her hands, if not
handsome to say to herself, "What should I be, if I were not
virtuous?" and if handsome to say to herself, "How good it were to
add virtue to beauty!" for it is a feather in the cap of a woman
not handsome to be loved for herself and not for good looks.</p>

appear handsome, wretch, but most unhandsome." For, as Crates says,
"that is adornment which adorns," and that adorns a woman that

her modesty.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxviii.</span> Plato advised
Xenocrates, a man rather austere but in all other respects a fine
fellow, to sacrifice to the Graces. I think also that a chaste wife
needs the graces with her husband that, as Metrodorus said, "she
may live agreeably with him, and not be bad-tempered because she is
chaste." For neither should the frugal wife neglect neatness, nor
the virtuous one neglect to make herself attractive, for
peevishness makes a wife's good conduct disagreeable, as untidiness
makes one disgusted with simplicity.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxix.</span> The wife who is afraid
to laugh and jest with her husband, lest she should appear bold and
wanton, resembles one that will not anoint herself with oil lest
she should be thought to use cosmetics, and will not wash her face
lest she should be thought to paint. We see also in the case of
those poets and orators, that avoid a popular illiberal and
affected style, that they artificially endeavour to move and sway
their audience by the facts, and by a skilful arrangement of them,
and by their gestures. Consequently a matron will do well to avoid
and repudiate over-preciseness meretriciousness and pomposity, and
to use tact in her dealings with her husband in every-day life,
accustoming him to a combination of pleasure and decorum. But if a
wife be by nature austere and apathetic, and no lover of pleasure,
the husband must make the best of it, for, as Phocion said, when
Antipater enjoined on him an action neither honourable nor
becoming, "You cannot have me as a friend and flatterer both," so
he must say to himself about his strict and austere wife, "I cannot
have in the same woman wife and mistress."</p>

a flute-player, she speaks more decorously by another
mouth-piece.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxxiii.</span> When rich men and
kings honour philosophers, they really pay homage to themselves as
well; but when philosophers pay court to the rich, they lower
themselves without advancing their patrons. The same is the case
with women. If they submit themselves to their husbands they
receive praise, but if they desire to rule, they get less credit
even than the husbands who submit to their rule. But the husband
ought to rule his wife, not as a master does a chattel, but as the
soul governs the body, by sympathy and goodwill. As he ought to
govern the body by not being a slave to its pleasures and desires,
so he ought to rule his wife by cheerfulness and complaisance.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxxiv.</span> The philosophers tell
us that some bodies are composed of distinct parts, as a fleet or
army; others of connected parts, as a house or ship; others united
and growing together, as every animal is. The marriage of lovers is
like this last class, that of those who marry for dowry or children
is like the second class, and that of those who only sleep together
is like the first class, who may be said to live in the same house,
but in no other sense to live together. But, just as doctors tell
us that liquids are the only things that thoroughly mix, so in
married people there must be a complete union of bodies, wealth,
friends, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id=

forbade married people to exchange presents with one another, not
that they should not go shares with one another, but that they

"#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> that if afterwards she
should be harsher still, she should be prepared for it and not take
it ill. Knowing this the wife ought to guard against any cause of
offence, for the bridegroom's mother is jealous of his affection to
his wife. But there is one cure for this condition of mind, to
conciliate privately the husband's affection, and not to divert or
diminish his love for his mother.</p>

their sons best as able to help them, and fathers their daughters

importance. But it looks very nice in the wife to show greater
respect to her husband's parents than to her own, and if anything
unpleasant has happened to confide it to them rather than to her
own people. For trust begets trust,<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id=

whether it consists of demonstration or constructive reasoning, by
associating and conversing with those that can profit you. And for

<p>And no less decorous is it to hear the wife say, "Husband, you
are my teacher and philosopher and guide in the most beautiful and
divine subjects." For such teaching in the first place detaches
women from absurdities: for the woman who has learnt geometry will
be ashamed to dance, nor will she believe in incantations and
spells, if she has been charmed by the discourses of Plato and
Xenophon; and if anyone should undertake to draw the moon down from
the sky, she will laugh at the ignorance and stupidity of women
that credit such nonsense, well understanding geometry, and having
heard how Aglaonice, the daughter of the Thessalian Hegetor, having
a thorough knowledge of the eclipses of the moon, and being aware
beforehand of the exact time when the moon would be in eclipse,
cheated the women, and persuaded them that she herself had drawn it
down from the sky. For no woman was ever yet credited with having
had a child without intercourse with a man, for those shapeless

<h3>CONSOLATORY LETTER TO HIS WIFE.</h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Plutarch to his wife sends
greeting. The messenger that you sent to me to announce the death
of our little girl seems to have missed his way <i>en route</i> for
Athens; but when I got to Tanagra I heard the news from my niece. I
suppose the funeral has already taken place, and I hope everything
went off so as to give you least sorrow both now and hereafter. But
if you left undone anything you wished to do, waiting for my
opinion, and thinking your grief would then be lighter, be it
without ceremoniousness or superstition, both which things are
indeed foreign to your character.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> Only, my dear wife, let us
both be patient at this calamity. I know and can see very clearly
how great it is, but should I find your grief too excessive, it
would trouble me even more than the event itself. And yet I have
not a heart hard as heart of oak or flintstone, as you yourself
know very well, who have shared with me in the bringing up of so
many children, as they have all been educated at home by ourselves.
And this one I know was more especially beloved by you, as she was
the first daughter after four sons, when you longed for a daughter,
and so I gave her your name.<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id=
"FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class=
"fnanchor">191</a> And as you are very fond of children your grief
must have a peculiar bitterness when you call to mind her pure and
simple gaiety, which was without a tincture of passion or
querulousness. For she had from nature a wonderful contentedness of
mind and meekness, and her affectionateness and winning ways not
only pleased one but also afforded a means of observing her
kindliness of heart, for she used to bid her nurse<a name=
"FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> give the teat not only
to other children but even to her favourite playthings, and so
invited them as it were to her table in kindliness of heart, and
gave them a share of her good things, and provided the best
entertainment for those that pleased her.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> But I see no reason, my
dear wife, why these and similar traits in her character, that gave
us delight in her lifetime,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86"
id="Page_86">86</a></span> should now, when recalled to the
memory, grieve and trouble us. Though, on the other hand, I fear
that if we cease to grieve we may also cease to remember her, like
Clymene, who says in the Play<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id=
"FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class=
"fnanchor">193</a>&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I hate the supple bow of
cornel-wood,</span> <span class="i0">And would put down
athletics,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>because she ever avoided and trembled at anything that reminded
her of her son, for it brought grief with it, and it is natural to
avoid everything that gives us pain. But as she gave us the
greatest pleasure in embracing her and even in seeing and hearing
her, so ought her memory living and dwelling with us to give us
more, aye, many times more, joy than grief, since those arguments
that we have often used to others ought to be profitable to us in
the present conjuncture, nor should we sit down and rail against
fortune, opposing to those joys many more griefs.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Those who were present at
the funeral tell me with evident surprise that you put on no
mourning, and that you bedizened up neither yourself nor your maids
with the trappings of woe, and that there was no ostentatious
expenditure of money at the funeral, but that everything was done
orderly and silently in the presence of our relations. I am not
myself surprised that you, who never made a display either at the
theatre or on any other public occasion, and thought extravagance
useless even in the case of pleasure, should have been frugal in
your grief. For not only ought the chaste woman to remain uncorrupt
in Bacchanalian revels,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id=
"FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class=
"fnanchor">194</a> but she ought to consider her self-control not a
whit less necessary in the surges of sorrow and emotion of grief,
contending not (as most people think) against natural affection,
but against the extravagant wishes of the soul. For we are
indulgent to natural affection in the regret, and honour, and
memory that it pays to the dead: but the insatiable desire for a
passionate display of funeral grief, coming to the climax in
coronachs and beatings of the breast, is not less unseemly than
intemperance in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id=
"Page_87">87</a></span>pleasure and is unreasonably<a name=
"FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> forgiven only because
pain and grief instead of delight are elements in the unseemly
exhibition. For what is more unreasonable than to curtail excessive
laughter or any other demonstration of joy, and to allow a free
vent to copious lamentation and wailing that come from the same
source? And how unreasonable is it, as some husbands do, to quarrel
with their wives about perfume and purple robes, while they allow
them to shear their heads in mourning, and to dress in black, and
to sit in idle grief, and to lie down in weariness! And what is
worst of all, how unreasonable is it for husbands to interfere if
their wives chastise the domestics and maids immoderately or
without sufficient cause, yet allow them to ill-treat themselves
cruelly in cases and conjunctures that require repose and
kindness!</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> But between us, my dear
wife, there never was any occasion for such a contest, nor do I
think there ever will be. For as to your economy in dress and
simple way of living, there is no philosopher with whom you are
acquainted whom you did not amaze, nor is there any citizen who has
not observed<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a
href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> how plainly you
dressed at sacred rites, and sacrifices, and theatres. You have
also already on similar painful occasions exhibited great
fortitude, as when you lost your eldest son, and again when our
handsome Ch&aelig;ron died. For when I was informed of his death, I
well remember some guests from the sea were coming home with me to
my house as well as some others, but when they saw the great quiet
and tranquillity of the household, they thought, as they afterwards
told some other people, that no such disaster had really happened,
but that the news was untrue. So well had you ordered everything in
the house, at a time when there would have been great excuse for
disorder. And yet you had suckled that son, though your breast had
had to be lanced owing to a contusion. This was noble conduct and
showed your great natural affection.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> But most mothers we see,
when their children are <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id=
"Page_88">88</a></span>brought to them clean and tidy, take them
into their hands as playthings, and when they die burst out into
idle and unthankful grief, not so much out of affection&mdash;for
affection is thoughtful and noble&mdash;but a great yearning for
vain glory<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a
href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> mixed with a
little natural affection makes their grief fierce and vehement and
hard to appease. And this does not seem to have escaped
&AElig;sop's notice, for he says that when Zeus assigned their
honours to various gods, Grief also claimed his. And Zeus granted
his wish, with this limitation that only those who chose and wished
need pay him honour.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id=
"FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class=
"fnanchor">198</a> It is thus with grief at the outset, everyone
welcomes it at first, but after it has got by process of time
settled, and become an inmate of the house, it is with difficulty
dislodged again, however much people may wish to dislodge it.
Wherefore we ought to keep it out of doors, and not let it approach
the garrison by wearing mourning or shearing the hair, or by any
similar outward sign of sorrow. For these things occurring daily
and being importunate make the mind little, and narrow, and
unsocial, and harsh, and timid, so that, being besieged and taken
in hand by grief, it can no longer laugh, and shuns daylight, and
avoids society. This evil will be followed by neglect of the body,
and dislike to anointing and the bath and the other usual modes of
life: whereas the very opposite ought to be the case, for the mind
ill at ease especially requires that the body should be in a sound
and healthy condition. For much of grief is blunted and relaxed
when the body is permeated by calm, like the sea in fine weather.
But if the body get into a dry and parched condition from a low
diet, and gives no proper nutriment to the soul, but only feeds it
with sorrow and grief, as it were with bitter and injurious
exhalations, it cannot easily recover its tone however people may
wish it should. Such is the state of the soul that has been so
ill-treated.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> Moreover, I should not
hesitate to assert<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id=

this is "the visits of bad women,"<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id=
"FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class=
"fnanchor">200</a> and their chatter, and joint lamentation, all
which things fan the fire of sorrow and aggravate it, and suffer it
not to be extinguished either by others or by itself. I am not
ignorant what a time of it you had lately, when you went to the aid
of Theon's sister, and fought against the women who came on a visit
of condolence and rushed up with lamentation and wailing, adding
fuel as it were to her fire of grief in their simplicity. For when
people see their friends' houses on fire they put it out as quickly
and energetically as they can, but when their souls are on fire
they themselves bring fuel. And if anybody has anything the matter
with his eyes they will not let him put his hands to them, however
much he wish, nor do they themselves touch the inflamed part; but a
person in grief sits down and gives himself up to every chance
comer, like a river [that all make use of], to stir up and
aggravate the sore, so that from a little tickling and discomfort
it grows into a great and terrible disease. However, as to all this
I know you will be on your guard.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> Try also often to carry
yourself back in memory to that time when, this little girl not
having been then born, we had nothing to charge Fortune with, and
to compare that time and this together, as if our circumstances had
gone back to what they were then. Otherwise, my dear wife, we shall
seem discontented at the birth of our little daughter, if we
consider our position before her birth as more perfect. But we
ought not to erase from our memory the two years of her life, but
to consider them as a time of pleasure giving us gratification and
enjoyment, and not to deem the shortness of the blessing as a great
evil, nor to be unthankful for what was given us, because Fortune
did not give us a longer tenure as we wished. For ever to be
careful what we say about the gods, and to be cheerful and not rail
against Fortune, brings a sweet and goodly profit; and he who in
such conjunctures as ours mostly tries to remember his blessings,
and turns and diverts his mind from the dark and disturbing things
in life to the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id=
"Page_90">90</a></span>bright and radiant, either altogether
extinguishes his grief or makes it small and dim from a comparison
with his comforts. For as perfume gives pleasure to the nose, and
is a remedy against disagreeable smells, so the remembrance of past
happiness in present trouble gives all the relief they require to
those who do not shut out of their memory the blessings of the
past, or always and everywhere rail against Fortune. And this
certainly ought not to be our case, that we should slander all our
past life because, like a book, it has one erasure in it, when all
the other pages have been bright and clean.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> You have often heard that
happiness consists in right calculations resulting in a healthy
state of mind, and that the changes which Fortune brings about need
not upset it, and introduce confusion into our life. But if we too
must, like most people, be governed by external events, and make an
inventory of the dealings of Fortune, and constitute other people
the judges of our felicity, do not now regard the tears and
lamentations of those who visit you, which by a faulty custom are
lavished on everybody, but consider rather how happy you are still
esteemed by them for your family, your house, and life. For it
would be monstrous, if others would gladly prefer your destiny to
theirs, even taking into account our present sorrow, that you
should rail against and be impatient at our present lot, and in
consequence of our bitter grief not reflect how much comfort is
still left to us. But like those who quote imperfect verses of
Homer<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> and neglect the finest
passages of his writings, to enumerate and complain of the trials
of life, while you pay no attention to its blessings, is to
resemble those stingy misers, who heap up riches and make no use of
them when they have them, but lament and are impatient if they are
lost. And if you grieve over her dying unmarried and childless, you
can comfort yourself with the thought that you have had both those
advantages. For they should not be reckoned as great blessings in
the case of those who do not enjoy them, and small blessings in the
case of those who do. And that she has gone to a <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>place where
she is out of pain ought not to pain us, for what evil can we mourn
for on her account if her pains are over? For even the loss of
important things does not grieve us when we have no need of them.
But it was only little things that your Timoxena was deprived of,
little things only she knew, and in little things only did she
rejoice; and how can one be said to be deprived of things of which
one had no conception, nor experience, nor even desire for?</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> As to what you hear from
some people, who get many to credit their notion, that the dead
suffer no evil or pain, I know that you are prevented from
believing that by the tradition of our fathers and by the mystic
symbols of the mysteries of Dionysus, for we are both initiated.
Consider then that the soul, being incorruptible, is in the same
condition after death as birds that have been caught. For if it has
been a long time in the body, and during this mortal life has
become tame by many affairs and long habit, it swoops down again
and a second time enters the body, and does not cease to be
involved in the changes and chances of this life that result from
birth. For do not suppose that old age is abused and ill-spoken of
only for its wrinkles and white hair and weakness of body, but this
is the worst feature about it, that it makes the soul feeble in its
remembrance of things in the other world, and strong in its
attachment to things in this world, and bends and presses it, if it
retain the form which it had in the body from its experience. But
that soul, which does indeed enter the body, but remains only a
short time in it, being liberated from it by the higher powers,
rears as it were at a damp and soft turning post in the race of
life, and hastens on to its destined goal. For just as if anyone
put out a fire, and light it again at once, it is soon rekindled,
and burns up again quickly, but if it has been out a long time, to
light it again will be a far more difficult and irksome task, so
the soul that has sojourned only a short time in this dark and
mortal life, quickly recovers the light and blaze of its former
bright life, whereas for those who have not had the good fortune
very early, to use the language of the poet, "to pass the gates of
Hades,"<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a
href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> nothing remains
but a great <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id=
"Page_92">92</a></span>passion for the things of this life, and a
softening of the soul through contact with the body, and a melting
away of it as if by the agency of drugs.<a name="FNanchor_203_203"
id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class=
"fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xi.</span> And the truth of this is
rendered more apparent in our hereditary and time-honoured customs
and laws. For when infants die no libations are poured out for
them, nor are any other rites performed for them, such as are
always performed for adults. For they have no share in the earth or
in things of the earth, nor do parents haunt their tombs or
monuments, or sit by their bodies when they are laid out. For the
laws do not allow us to mourn for such, seeing that it is an
impious thing to do so in the case of persons who have departed
into a better and more divine place and sphere. I know that doubts
are entertained about this, but since to doubt is harder for them
than to believe, let us do externally as the laws enjoin, and
internally let us be more holy and pure and chaste.<a name=

<h3><a name="Page_92a" id="Page_92a">THAT VIRTUE MAY BE
TAUGHT.</a></h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> As to virtue we deliberate
and dispute whether good sense, and justice, and rectitude can be
taught: and then we are not surprised that, while the works of
orators, and pilots, and musicians, and house-builders, and
farmers, are innumerable, good men are only a name and expression,
like Centaurs and Giants and Cyclopes, and that it is impossible to
find any virtuous action without alloy of base motives, or any
character free from vice: but if nature produces spontaneously
anything good, it is marred by much that is alien to it, as fruit
choked by weeds. Men learn to play on the harp, and to dance, and
to read, and to farm, and to ride on horseback: they learn how to
put on their shoes and clothes generally: people teach how <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>to pour
out wine, how to cook; and all these things cannot be properly
performed, without being learned. The art of good living alone,
though all those things I have mentioned only exist on its account,
is untaught, unmethodical, inartistic, and supposed to come by the
light of nature!</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> O sirs, by asserting that
virtue is not a thing to be taught, why are we making it unreal?
For if teaching produces it, the deprivation of teaching prevents
it. And yet, as Plato says, a discord and false note on the lyre
makes not brother go to war with brother, nor sets friends at
variance, nor makes states hostile to one another, so as to do and
suffer at one another's hands the most dreadful things:<a name=
"FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> nor can anyone say
that there was ever a dissension in any city as to the
pronunciation of Telchines: nor in a private house any difference
between man and wife as to woof and warp. And yet no one without
learning would undertake to ply the loom, or write a book, or play
on the lyre, though he would thereby do no great harm, but he fears
making himself ridiculous, for as Heraclitus says, "It is better to
hide one's ignorance," yet everyone thinks himself competent to
manage a house and wife and the state and hold any magisterial
office. On one occasion, when a boy was eating rather greedily,
Diogenes gave the lad's tutor a blow with his fist, ascribing the
fault not to the boy, who had not learnt how to eat properly, but
to the tutor who had not taught him. And can one not properly
handle a dish or a cup, unless one has learnt from a boy, as
Aristophanes bids us, "not to giggle, nor eat too fast, nor cross
our legs,"<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a
href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> and yet be
perfectly fit to manage a family and city, and wife, and live well,
and hold office, when one has not learnt how one should behave in
the conduct of life? When Aristippus was asked by someone, "Are you
everywhere then?" he smiled and said, "If I am everywhere, I lose
my passage money."<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id=
"FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class=
"fnanchor">207</a> Why should not you also say, "If men are not
better for learning, the money paid to tutors is also lost?" For
just as nurses mould with their hands <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>the child's body, so
tutors, receiving it immediately it is weaned, mould its soul,
teaching it by habit the first vestiges of virtue. And the
Laced&aelig;monian, who was asked, what good he did as a tutor,
replied, "I make what is good pleasant to boys." Moreover tutors
teach boys to walk in the streets with their heads down,<a name=
"FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> to touch salt fish
with one finger only, other fish bread and meat with two, to
scratch themselves in such a way, and in such a way to put on their
cloak.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> What then? He that says
that the doctor's skill is wanted in the case of a slight
skin-eruption or whitlow, but is not needed in the case of
pleurisy, fever, or lunacy, in what respect does he differ from the
man that says that schools and teaching and precepts are only for
small and boyish duties, while great and important matters are to
be left to mere routine and accident? For, as the man is ridiculous
who says we ought to learn to row but not to steer, so he who
allows all other arts to be learnt, but not virtue, seems to act
altogether contrary to the Scythians. For they, as Herodotus tells
us,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> blind their slaves
that they may remain with them, but such an one puts the eye of
reason into slavish and servile arts, and takes it away from
virtue. And the general Iphicrates well answered Callias, the son
of Chabrias, who asked him, "What are you? an archer? a targeteer?
cavalry, or infantry?" "None of these," said he, "but the commander
of them all." Ridiculous therefore is he who says that the use of
the bow and other arms and the sling and riding are to be taught,
but that strategy and how to command an army comes by the light of
nature. Still more ridiculous is he who asserts that good sense
alone need not be taught, without which all other arts are useless
and profitless, seeing that she is the mistress and orderer and
arranger of all of them, and puts each of them to their proper use.
For example, what grace would there be in a banquet, though the
servants had been well-trained, and had learnt how to dress and
cook <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id=

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Clothes seem to warm a man,
not by throwing out heat themselves (for in itself every garment is
cold, whence in great heat or in fevers people frequently change
and shift them), but the heat which a man throws out from his own
body is retained and wrapped in by a dress fitting close to the
body, which does not admit of the heat being dissipated when once
it has got firm hold. A somewhat similar case is the idea that
deceives the mass of mankind, that if they could live in big
houses, and get together a quantity of slaves and money, they would
have a happy life. But a happy and cheerful life is not from
without, on the contrary, a man adds the pleasure and gratification
to the things that surround him, his temperament being as it were
the source of his feelings.<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id=

<p>So, too, wealth is pleasanter, and fame and power more splendid,
when a man has joy in his heart, seeing that men can bear easily
and quietly poverty and exile and old age if their character is a
contented and mild one.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> For as perfumes make
threadbare coats and rags to smell sweet, while the body of
Anchises sent forth a fetid <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96"
id="Page_96">96</a></span> discharge, "distilling from his back on
to his linen robe," so every kind of life with virtue is painless
and pleasurable, whereas vice if infused into it makes splendour
and wealth and magnificence painful, and sickening, and unwelcome
to its possessors.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"He is deemed happy in the

<p>And yet there would be no great difficulty in getting rid of a
bad wife, if one was a man and not a slave. But a man cannot by
writing a bill of divorce to his vice get rid of all trouble at
once, and enjoy tranquillity by living apart: for it is ever
present in his vitals, and sticks to him night and day, "and burns
without a torch, and consigns him to gloomy old age,"<a name=
"FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> being a disagreeable
fellow-traveller owing to its arrogance, and a costly companion at
table owing to its daintiness, and an unpleasant bed-fellow,
disturbing and marring sleep by anxiety and care and envy. For
during such a one's sleep the body indeed gets rest, but the mind
has terrors, and dreams, and perturbations, owing to
superstition,</p>

<p>as one says. For thus envy, and fear, and anger, and lust affect
one. During the daytime, indeed, vice looks abroad and imitates the
behaviour of others, is shy and conceals its evil desires, and does
not altogether give way to its propensities, but often even resists
and fights stoutly against them; but in sleep it escapes the
observation of people and the law, and, being as far as possible
removed from fear or modesty, gives every passion play, and excites
its depravity and licentiousness, for, to borrow Plato's
expression,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a
href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> "it attempts

is practicable in visions and phantasies, that end in no complete
pleasure or satisfaction, but can only stir up and inflame the
passions and morbid emotions.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> Where then is the
pleasure of vice, if there is nowhere in it freedom from anxiety
and pain, or independence, or tranquillity, or rest?<a name=

"#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> A healthy and sound
constitution does indeed augment the pleasures of the body, but for
the soul there can be no lasting joy or gratification, unless
cheerfulness and fearlessness and courage supply a calm serenity
free from storms; for otherwise, even if hope or delight smile on
the soul, it is soon confused and disturbed by care lifting up its
head again, so that it is but the calm of a sunken rock.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Pile up gold, heap up
silver, build covered walks, fill your house with slaves and the
town with debtors, unless you lay to rest the passions of the soul,
and put a curb on your insatiable desires, and rid yourself of fear
and anxiety, you are but pouring out wine for a man in a fever, and
giving honey to a man who is bilious, and laying out a sumptuous
banquet for people who are suffering from dysentery, and can
neither retain their food nor get any benefit from it, but are made
even worse by it. Have you never observed how sick persons turn
against and spit out and refuse the daintiest and most costly
viands, though people offer them and almost force them down their
throats, but on another occasion, when their condition is
different, their respiration good, their blood in a healthy state,
and their natural warmth restored, they get up, and enjoy and make
a good meal of simple bread and cheese and cress? Such, also, is
the effect of reason on the mind. You will be contented, if you
have learned what is good and honourable. You will live daintily
and be a king in poverty, and enjoy a quiet and private life as
much as the public life of general or statesman. By the aid of
philosophy you will live not unpleasantly, for you will learn to
extract pleasure from all places <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>and things: wealth will make
you happy, because it will enable you to benefit many; and poverty,
as you will not then have many anxieties; and glory, for it will
make you honoured; and obscurity, for you will then be safe from
envy.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_98a" id="Page_98a">ON MORAL VIRTUE.</a></h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> I propose to discuss what
is called and appears to be moral virtue (which differs mainly from
contemplative virtue in that it has emotion for its matter, and
reason for its form), what its nature is, and how it subsists, and
whether that part of the soul which takes it in is furnished with
reason of its own, or participates in something foreign, and if the
latter, whether as things that are mixed with something better than
themselves, or rather as that which is subject to superintendence
and command, and may be said to share in the power of that which
commands. For I think it is clear that virtue can exist and
continue altogether free from matter and mixture. My best course
will be to run briefly over the views of others, not so much to
display my research as because, when their ideas have been set
forth, mine will become more clear and be on a firmer basis.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> Menedemus of Eretria took
away the number and differences of virtues, on the ground that
virtue was one though it had many names; for that just as mortal is
synonymous with man, so temperance and bravery and justice were the
same thing. And Aristo of Chios also made virtue one in substance,
and called it soundness of mind: its diversities and varieties only
existing in certain relations, as if one called our sight when it
took in white objects white-sight, and when it took in black
objects black-sight, and so on. For virtue, when it considers what
it ought to do and what it ought not to do, is called prudence; and
when it curbs passion, and sets a fit and proper limit to pleasure,
it is called self-control; and when it is associated with our
dealings and covenants with one another, it is called justice; just
as a knife is one article,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99"
id="Page_99">99</a></span> though at different times it cuts
different things in half: and so, too, fire acts on different
matter though it has but one property. And Zeno of Cittium seems to
incline somewhat to the same view, as he defines prudence in
distribution as justice, in choice as self-control, in endurance as
fortitude: and those who defend these views maintain that by the
term prudence Zeno means knowledge. But Chrysippus, thinking each
particular virtue should be arranged under its particular quality,
unwittingly stirred up, to use Plato's language, "a whole swarm of
virtues,"<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a
href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> unusual and
unknown. For as from brave we get bravery, and from mild mildness,
and from just justice, so from acceptable he got acceptableness,
and from good goodness, and from great greatness, and from the
honourable honourableness, and he made virtues of many other such
clevernesses, affabilities, and versatilities, and filled
philosophy, which did not at all require it, with many strange
names.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> Now all these agree in
supposing virtue to be a disposition and faculty of the governing
part of the soul set in motion by reason, or rather to be reason
itself conformable and firm and immutable. They think further that
the emotional and unreasoning part of the soul is not by any
natural difference distinct from the reasoning part, but that that
same part of the soul, which they call intellect and the leading
principle of action, being altogether diverted and changed by the
passions, and by the alterations which habit or disposition have
brought about, becomes either vice or virtue, without having in
itself any unreasoning element, but that it is called unreasoning
when, by the strong and overpowering force of appetite, it launches
out into excesses contrary to the direction of reason. For passion,
according to them, is only vicious and intemperate reason, getting
its strength and power from bad and faulty judgement. But all of
those philosophers seem to have been ignorant that we are all in
reality two-fold and composite, though they did not recognize it,
and only saw the more evident mixture of soul and body. And yet
that there is in the soul itself something composite and two-fold
and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id=
"Page_100">100</a></span>dissimilar (the unreasoning part of it, as
if another body, being by necessity and nature mixed up with and
united to reason), seems not to have escaped the notice even of
Pythagoras, as we infer from his zeal for music, which he
introduced to calm and soothe the soul, as knowing that it was not
altogether amenable to precept and instruction, or redeemable from
vice only by reason, but that it needed some other persuasion and
moulding and softening influence to co-operate with reason, unless
it were to be altogether intractable and refractory to philosophy.
And Plato saw very plainly and confidently and decidedly that the
soul of this universe is not simple or uncomposite or uniform, but
is made up of forces that work uniformly and differently, in the
one case it is ever marshalled in the same order and moves about in
one fixed orbit, in the other case it is divided into motions and
orbits contrary to each other and changing about, and thus
generates differences in things. So, too, the soul of man, being a
part or portion of the soul of the universe, and compounded upon
similar principles and proportions, is not simple or entirely
uniform, but has one part intelligent and reasoning, which is
intended by nature to rule and dominate in man, and another part
unreasoning, and subject to passion and caprice, and disorderly,
and in need of direction. And this last again is divided into two
parts, one of which, being most closely connected with the body, is
called desire, and the other, sometimes taking part with the body,
sometimes with reason, lending its influence against the body, is
called anger. And the difference between reason and sense on the
one hand, and anger and desire on the other, is shown by their
antipathy to one another, so that they are often at variance with
one another as to what is best.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id=
"FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class=
"fnanchor">220</a> These were at first<a name="FNanchor_221_221"
id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class=
"fnanchor">221</a> the views of Aristotle, as is clear from his
writings, though afterwards he joined anger to desire, as if anger
were nothing but a desire and passion for revenge. However, he
always considered the emotional and unreasoning part of the soul as
distinct from the reasoning, not that it is altogether unreasoning
as the perceptive, or nutritive, or <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>vegetative portions of the
soul, for these are always deaf and disobedient to reason, and in a
certain sense are off-shoots from the flesh, and altogether
attached to the body; but the emotional, though it is destitute of
any reason of its own, yet is naturally inclined to listen to
reason and sense, and turn and submit and mould itself accordingly,
unless it be entirely corrupted by brute pleasure and a life of
indulgence.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> As for those who wonder
that what is unreasoning should obey reason, they do not seem to me
to recognize the power of reason, how great it is, and how
far-reaching its dominion is&mdash;a power not gained by harsh and
repelling methods, but by attractive ones, as mild persuasion which
always accomplishes more than compulsion or violence. For even the
spirit and nerves and bones, and other parts of the body, though
devoid of reason, yet at any instigation of reason, when she shakes
as it were the reins, are all on the alert and compliant and
obedient, the feet to run, and the hands to throw or lift, at her
bidding. Right excellently has the poet set forth in the following
lines the sympathy and accordance between the unreasoning and
reason:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Thus were her beauteous
cheeks diffused with tears,</span> <span class="i0">Weeping her
husband really present then.</span> <span class="i0">But though
Odysseus pitied her in heart,</span> <span class="i0">His eyes like
horn or steel impassive stood</span> <span class="i0">Within their
lids, and craft his tears repressed."<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id=
"FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class=
"fnanchor">222</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>So completely under the control of judgement did he keep his
spirit and blood and tears. The same is shown by the subsidence of
our passions, which are laid to rest in the presence of handsome
women or boys, whom reason and the law forbid us to touch; a case
which most frequently happens to lovers, when they hear that they
have unwittingly fallen in love with a sister or daughter. For at
once passion is laid at the voice of reason, and the body exhibits
its members as subservient to decorum. And frequently in the case
of dainty food, people very much attracted by it, if they find out
at the time or learn afterwards that they have eaten what is
unclean or unlawful, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id=
"Page_102">102</a></span>not only suffer distress and grief in
their imagination, but even their very body is upset by the notion,
and violent retchings and vomitings follow.<a name=
"FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> I fear I should seem
to be introducing merely novel and enticing arguments, if I were to
enumerate stringed instruments and lyres, and harps and flutes, and
other harmonious musical instruments, which, although inanimate,
yet speak to man's passions, rejoicing with him, and mourning with
him, and chiming in with him, and rioting with him,&mdash;in a
word, falling in with the vein and emotions and characters of those
that play on them. And they say that Zeno on one occasion, going
into the theatre when Am&oelig;beus<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id=
"FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class=
"fnanchor">224</a> was playing on the harp, said to the pupils,
"Let us go and learn what music can be produced by guts and nerves
and wood and bones, when they preserve proportion and time and
order." But passing these things over, I would gladly learn from
them, if, when they see dogs and horses and birds domesticated, and
by habit and training uttering sounds that can be understood, and
making obedient movements and gestures, and acting quietly and
usefully to us, and when they notice that Achilles in Homer cheers
on horses as well as men to the fight,<a name="FNanchor_225_225"
id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class=
"fnanchor">225</a> they still wonder and doubt, whether the
passionate and emotional and painful and pleasurable elements in us
are by nature obedient to the voice of reason, and influenced and
affected by it, seeing that those elements are not apart from us or
detached from us, or formed from outside, or hammered into us by
force, but are innate in us, and ever associate with us, and are
nourished within us, and abound in us through habit. Accordingly
moral character is well called by the Greeks
&#7975;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;, for it is, to speak generally, a
quality of the unreasoning element in man, and is called
&#7975;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf; because the unreasoning element
moulded by reason receives this quality and difference by habit,
which is called &#7956;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;.<a name=
"FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> Not that reason wishes
to expel passion altogether (that is neither <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>possible,
nor advisable), but only to keep it within bounds and order, and to
engender the moral virtues, which are not apathetic, but hold the
due proportion and mean in regard to passion. And this she does by
reducing the power of passion to a good habit. For there are said
to be three things existing in the soul, power, passion, and habit.
Power is the principle or matter of passion, as power to be angry,
ashamed, or confident: and passion is the actual setting in motion
of that power, being itself anger, confidence, or shame; and habit
is the strong formation of power in the unreasoning element
engendered by use, being vice if the passions are badly tutored by
reason, virtue if they are well tutored.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> But since they do not
regard every virtue as a mean, nor call it moral, we must discuss
this difference by approaching the matter more from first
principles. Some things in the world exist absolutely, as the
earth, the sky, the stars, and the sea; others have relation to us,
as good and evil, as what is desirable or to be avoided, as
pleasant and painful: and since reason has an eye to both of these
classes, when it considers the former it is scientific and
contemplative, when it considers the latter it is deliberative and
practical. And prudence is the virtue in the latter case, as
knowledge in the former. And there is this difference between
prudence and knowledge, prudence consists in applying the
contemplative to the practical and emotional so as to make reason
paramount. On which account it often needs the help of fortune;
whereas knowledge needs neither the help of fortune nor
deliberation to gain its ends: for it considers only things which
are always the same. And as the geometrician does not deliberate
about the triangle, as to whether its interior angles are together
equal to two right angles, for he knows it as a fact&mdash;and
deliberation only takes place in the case of things which differ at
different times, not in the case of things which are certain and
unchangeable&mdash;so the contemplative mind having its scope in
first principles, and things that are fixed, and that ever have one
nature which does not admit of change, has no need for
deliberation. But prudence, which has to enter into matters full of
obscurity and confusion, frequently has to take its chance,
and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id=
"Page_104">104</a></span> to deliberate about things which are
uncertain, and, in carrying the deliberation into practice, has to
co-operate with the unreasoning element, which comes to its help,
and is involved in its decisions, for they need an impetus. Now
this impetus is given to passion by the moral character, an impetus
requiring reason to regulate it, that it may render moderate and
not excessive help, and at the seasonable time. For the emotional
and unreasoning elements are subject to motions sometimes too quick
and vehement, at other times too remiss and slow. And so everything
we do may be a success from one point of view, but a failure from
many points of view; as to hit the mark one thing only is
requisite, but one may miss it in various ways, as one may shoot
beyond or too short. This then is the function of practical reason
following nature, to prevent our passions going either too far or
too short. For where from weakness and want of strength, or from
fear and hesitation, the impetus gives in and abandons what is
good, there reason is by to stir it up and rekindle it; and where
on the other hand it goes ahead too fast and in disorder, there it
represses and checks its zeal. And thus setting bounds to the
emotional motions, it engenders in the unreasoning part of the soul
moral virtues, which are the mean between excess and deficiency.
Not that we can say that all virtue exists in the mean, but
knowledge and prudence being in no need of the unreasoning element,
and being situated in the pure and unemotional part of the soul, is
a complete perfection and power of reason, whereby we get the most
divine and happy fruit of understanding. But that virtue which is
necessary because of the body, and needs the help of the passions
as an instrument towards the practical, not destroying or doing
away with but ordering and regulating the unreasoning part of the
soul, is perfection as regards its power and quality, but in
quantity it is a mean correcting both excess and deficiency.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> But since the word mean
has a variety of meanings&mdash;for there is one kind of mean
compounded of two simple extremes, as grey is the mean between
white and black; and there is another kind of mean, where that
which contains and is contained is the mean between the containing
and contained, as eight is the mean between twelve and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span> four; and
there is a third kind of mean which has part in neither extreme, as
the indifferent is the mean between good and bad,&mdash;virtue
cannot be a mean in any of these ways. For neither is it a mixture
of vices, nor containing that which is defective is it contained by
that which is excessive, nor is it again altogether free from,
emotional storms of passion, wherein are excess and deficiency. But
it is, and is commonly so called, a mean like that in music and
harmony. For as in music there is a middle note between the highest
and lowest in the scale, which being perfectly in tune avoids the
sharpness of the one and the flatness of the other; so virtue,
being a motion and power in the unreasoning part of the soul, takes
away the remissness and strain, and generally speaking the excess
and defect of the appetite, by reducing each of the passions to a
state of mean and rectitude. For example, they tell us that bravery
is the mean between cowardice and foolhardiness, whereof the former
is a defect, the latter an excess of anger: and that liberality is
the mean between stinginess and prodigality: and that meekness is
the mean between insensibility and savageness: and so of temperance
and justice, that the latter, being concerned with contracts, is to
assign neither too much nor too little to litigants, and that the
former ever reduces the passions to the proper mean between apathy
(or insensibility) and gross intemperance. This last illustration
serves excellently to show us the radical difference between the
unreasoning and reasoning parts of the soul, and to prove to us
that passion and reason are wide as the poles asunder. For the
difference would not be discernible between temperance and
continence, nor between intemperance and incontinence, in pleasure
and desires, if the appetite and judgement were in the same portion
of the soul. Now temperance is a state, wherein reason holds the
reins, and manages the passions as a quiet and well-broken-in
animal, finding them obedient and submissive to the reins and
masters over their desires.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id=
"FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class=
"fnanchor">227</a> Continence on the other hand is not driven by
reason without some trouble, not being docile but jibbing and <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id=
"Page_106">106</a></span>kicking, like an animal compelled by bit
and bridle and whip and backing, being in itself full of struggles
and commotion. Plato explains this by his simile of the
chariot-horses of the soul, the worse one of which ever kicking
against the other and disturbing the charioteer, he is obliged ever
to hold them in with all his might, and to tighten the reins, lest,
to borrow the language of Simonides, "he should drop from his hands
the purple reins." And so they do not consider continence to be an
absolute virtue, but something less than a virtue; for no mean
arises from the concord of the worse with the better, nor is the
excess of the passion curtailed, nor does the appetite obey or act
in unison with reason, but it both gives and suffers trouble, and
is constrained by force, and is as it were an enemy in a town given
up to faction.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"The town is full of incense,
and at once</span> <span class="i0">Resounds with triumph-songs and
bitter wailing."<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id=
"FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class=
"fnanchor">228</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Such is the state of soul of the continent person owing to his
conflicting condition. On the same grounds they consider
incontinence to be something less than vice, but intemperance to be
a complete vice. For it, having both its appetite and reason
depraved, is by the one carried away to desire disgraceful
things,<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a
href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> by the other,
through bad judgement consenting to desire, loses even the
perception of wrongdoing. But incontinence keeps its judgement
sound through reason, but is carried away against its judgement by
passion which is too strong for reason, whence it differs from
intemperance. For in the one case reason is mastered by passion, in
the other it does not even make a fight against it, in the one case
it opposes its desires even when it follows them, in the other it
is their advocate and even leader, in the one case it gladly
participates in what is wrong, in the other sorrowfully, in the one
case it willingly rushes into what is disgraceful, in the other it
abandons the honourable unwillingly. And as there is a difference
in their deeds, so no less manifest is the difference <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>in their
language. For these are the expressions of the intemperate. "What
grace or pleasure in life is there without golden Aphrodite? May I
die, when I care no longer for these things!" And another says, "To
eat, to drink, to enjoy the gifts of Aphrodite is everything, for
all other things I look upon as supplementary," as if from the
bottom of his soul he gave himself up to pleasures, and was
completely subverted by them. And not less so he who said, "Let me
be ruined, it is best for me," had his judgement diseased through
his passion. But the sayings of incontinence are quite different,
as</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"My nature forces me against

<p>And again&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"My anger draws me on, has no
control,</span> <span class="i0">'Tis but a sandy hook against a
tempest."</span></div>
</div>

<p>Here he compares not badly to a sandy hook, a sorry kind of
anchor, the soul that is unsettled and has no steady reason, but
surrenders judgment through flabbiness and feebleness. And not
unlike this image are the lines,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"As some ship moored and
fastened to the shore,</span> <span class="i0">If the wind blows,
the cables cannot hold it."</span></div>
</div>

<p>By cables he means the judgement which resists what is
disgraceful, though sometimes it gives way under a tremendous storm
of passion. For indeed it is with full sail that the intemperate
man is borne on to pleasure by his desires, and surrenders himself
to them, and even plays the part of pilot to the vessel; whereas
the incontinent man is dragged sidelong into the disgraceful, and
is its victim, as it were, while he desires eagerly to resist and
overcome his passion, as Timon bantered Anaxarchus: "The
recklessness and frantic energy of Anaxarchus to rush anywhere
seemed like a dog's courage, but he being aware of it was
miserable, so people said, but his voluptuous nature ever plunged
him into excesses again, nature which even <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>most sophists are
afraid of." For neither is the wise man continent but temperate,
nor the fool incontinent but intemperate; for the one delights in
what is good, and the other is not vexed at what is bad.
Incontinence, therefore, is a mark of a sophistical soul, endued
with reason which cannot abide by what it knows to be right.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> Such, then, are the
differences between incontinence and intemperance, and continence
and temperance have their counterpart and analogous differences;
for remorse and trouble and annoyance are companions of continence,
whereas in the soul of the temperate person there is everywhere
such equability and calm and soundness, by which the unreasoning is
adjusted and harmonized to reason, being adorned with obedience and
wonderful mildness, that looking at it you would say with the poet,
"At once the wind was laid, and a wondrous calm ensued, for the god
allayed the fury of the waves,"<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id=
"FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class=
"fnanchor">232</a> reason having extinguished the vehement and
furious and frantic motions of the desires, and making those which
nature necessarily requires sympathetic and obedient and friendly
and co-operative in carrying purposes out in action, so that they
do not outrun or come short of reason, or behave disorderly and
disobediently, but that every appetite is tractable, "as sucking
foal runs by the side of its dam."<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id=
"FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class=
"fnanchor">233</a> And this confirms the saying of Xenocrates about
true philosophers, that they alone do willingly what all others do
unwillingly at the compulsion of the law, as dogs are turned away
from their pleasures by a blow, or cats by a noise, looking at
nothing but their danger. It is clear then that there is in the
soul a perception of such a generic and specific difference in
relation to the desires, as of something fighting against and
opposing them. But some say that there is no radical distinction
difference or variance between reason and passion, but that there
is a shifting of one and the same reason from one to the other,
which escapes our notice owing to the sharpness and quickness of
the change, so that we do not see at a glance that desire and
repentance, anger and fear, giving way to what is disgraceful <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id=
"Page_109">109</a></span>through passion, and recovery from the
same, are the same natural property of the soul. For desire and
fear and anger and the like they consider only depraved opinions
and judgements, not in one portion of the soul only but in all its
leading principles, inclinations and yieldings, and assents and
impulses, and generally speaking in its energies soon changed, like
the sallies of children, whose fury and excessive violence is
unstable by reason of their weakness. But these views are, in the
first place, contrary to evidence and observation; for no one
observes in himself a change from passion to judgement, and from
judgement back to passion; nor does anyone cease from loving when
he reflects that it would be well to break the affair off and
strive with all his might against it; nor again, does he put on one
side reflection and judgement, when he gives way and is overcome by
desire. Moreover, when he resists passion by reason, he does not
escape passion altogether; nor again, when he is mastered by
passion does he fail to discern his fault through reason: so that
neither by passion does he abolish reason, nor does he by reason
get rid of passion, but is tossed about to and fro alternately
between passion and reason. And those who suppose that the leading
principle in the soul is at one time desire, and at another time
reason in opposition to desire, are not unlike people who would
make the hunter and the animal he hunts one and the same person,
but alternately changing from hunter to animal, from animal to
hunter. As their eyesight is plainly deficient, so these are faulty
in regard to their perceptions, seeing that they must perceive in
themselves not a change of one and the same thing, but a difference
and struggle between two opposing elements. "What then," say they,
"does not the deliberative element in a man often hold different
views, and is it not swayed to different opinions as to expediency,
and yet it is one and the same thing?" Certainly, I reply; but the
case is not similar. For the rational part of the soul does not
fight against itself, but though it has only one faculty, it makes
use of different reasonings; or rather the reasoning is one, but
employs itself in different subjects as on different matter. And so
there is neither pain in reasonings without passion, nor are men
compelled, as it were, to choose something contrary to<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span> their
judgement, unless indeed some passion, as in a balance, secretly
predominates in the scale. For this often happens, reason not
opposing reason, but ambition, or contention, or favour, or
jealousy, or fear opposing reason, that we do but think there is a
difference between two reasons, as in the line, "They were ashamed
to refuse, and feared to accept,"<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id=
"FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class=
"fnanchor">234</a> or, "To die in battle is dreadful but glorious;
but not to die, though cowardly, is more pleasant." Moreover, in
judgements about contracts passions come in and cause the greatest
delay; and in the councils of kings those who speak to ingratiate
themselves do not favour either of the two cases, but give
themselves up to passion without regard to what is expedient; and
so those that rule in aristocracies do not allow orators to be
pathetic in their pleadings. For reasoning without passion has a
direct tendency to justice, while if passion is infused, a contest
and difference is excited between pleasure and pain on the one
hand, and judgement and justice on the other. For otherwise how is
it that in philosophical speculations people are with little pain
frequently induced by others to change their opinions, and even
Aristotle himself and Democritus and Chrysippus have rejected
without trouble or pain, and even with pleasure, some of the
opinions which they formerly advocated? For no passion stands in
the way in the theoretic and scientific part of the soul, and the
unreasoning element is quiet and gives no trouble therein. And so
reason gladly inclines to the truth, when it is evident, and
abandons error; for in it, and not in passion, lies a willingness
to listen to conviction and to change one's opinions on conviction.
But the deliberations and judgements and arbitrations of most
people as to matters of fact being mixed up with passion, give
reason no easy or pleasant access, as she is held fast and
incommoded by the unreasonable, which assails her through pleasure,
or fear, or pain, or desire. And the decision in these cases lies
with sense which has dealings with both passion and reason, for if
one gets the better of the other the other is not destroyed, but
only dragged along by force in spite of its resistance. For he who
is dissatisfied with himself for <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>falling in love calls in
reason to his aid to overcome his passion, for both reason and
passion are in his soul, and he perceives they are contrary one to
the other, and violently represses the inflammatory one of the two.
On the other hand, in deliberations and speculations without
passion (such as the contemplative part of the soul is most
conversant with), if they are evenly balanced no decision takes
place, but the matter is left in doubt, which is a sort of
stationary position of the mind in conflicting arguments. But
should there be any inclination to one of the two sides, the most
powerful opinion carries the day, yet without giving pain or
creating hostility. And, generally speaking, when reason seems
opposed to reason, there is no perception of two distinct things,
but only of one under different phases, whereas when the
unreasoning has a controversy with reason, since there can be no
victory or defeat without pain, forthwith they tear the soul in
two,<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> and make the
difference between them apparent.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> And not only from their
contest, but quite as much from their agreement, can we see that
the source of the passions is something quite distinct from that of
reason. For since<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id=
"FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class=
"fnanchor">236</a> one may love either a good and excellent child
or a bad and vicious one, and be unreasonably angry with one's
children or parents, yet in behalf of them show a just anger
against enemies or tyrants; as in the one case there is the
perception of a difference and struggle between passion and reason,
so in the other there is a perception of persuasion and agreement
inclining, as it were, the scale, and giving their help. Moreover a
good man marrying a wife according to the laws is minded to
associate and live with her justly and soberly, but as time goes
on, his intercourse with her having engendered a strong passion for
her, he perceives that his love and affection are increased by
reason. Just so, again, young fellows falling in with kindly
teachers at first submit themselves to them out of necessity and
emulation for learning, but end by loving them, and instead of
being their pupils and scholars become and get the title of their
lovers. The same is the case in cities in respect to good <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id=
"Page_112">112</a></span>magistrates, and neighbours, and
connections by marriage; for beginning at first to associate with
one another from necessity and propriety, they afterwards go on to
love almost insensibly, reason drawing over and persuading the
emotional element. And he who said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"There are two kinds of shame,
the one not bad,</span> <span class="i0">The other a sad burden to
a family,"<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a
href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>is it not clear that he felt this emotion in himself often
contrary to reason and detrimental by hesitation and delay to
opportunities and actions?</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> In a certain sense
yielding to the force of these arguments, they call shame modesty,
pleasure joy, and timidity caution; nor would anyone blame them for
this euphemism, if they only gave those specious names to the
emotions that are consistent with reason, while they gave other
kinds of names to those emotions that resist and do violence to
reason. But whenever, though convicted by their tears and
tremblings and changes of colour, they avoid the terms pain and
fear, and speak of bitings and states of excitement, and gloss over
the passions by calling them inclinations, they seem to contrive
evasions and flights from facts by names sophistical, and not
philosophical. And yet again they seem to use words rightly when
they call those joys and wishes and cautions not apathies but good
conditions of the mind. For it is a happy disposition of the soul
when reason does not annihilate passion, but orders and arranges it
in the case of temperate persons. But what is the condition of
worthless and incontinent persons, who, when they judge they ought
to love their father and mother better than some boy or girl they
are enamoured of, yet cannot, and yet at once love their mistress
or flatterer, when they judge they ought to hate them? For if
passion and judgement were the same thing, love and hate would
immediately follow the judging it right to love and hate, whereas
the contrary happens, passion following some judgements, but
declining to follow others. Wherefore they acknowledge, the facts
compelling them to do so, that every judgement is not passion, but
only that judgement that is provocative of violent and excessive
impulse: ad<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id=
"Page_113">113</a></span>mitting that judgement and passion in us
are something different, as what moves is different from what is
moved. Even Chrysippus himself, by his defining in many places
endurance and continence to be habits that follow the lead of
reason, proves that he is compelled by the facts to admit, that
that element in us which follows absolutely is something different
from that which follows when persuaded, but resists when not
persuaded.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> Now as to those who make
all sins and offences equal, it is not now the occasion to discuss
if in other respects they deviate from truth: but as regards the
passions<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a
href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">238</a> they seem to go
clean contrary to reason and evidence. For according to them every
passion is a sin, and everyone who grieves, or fears, or desires,
commits sin. But in good truth it is evident that there are great
differences between passions, according as one is more or less
affected by them. For who would say that the craven fear of Dolon<a
name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> was not something very
different from the fear of Ajax, "who retreated with his face to
the enemy and at a foot's pace, drawing back slowly knee after
knee"?<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> Or who would say that
the grief of Plato at the death of Socrates was identical with the
grief of Alexander at the death of Clitus, when he attempted to lay
violent hands on himself? For grief is beyond measure intensified
by falling out against expectation: and the calamity that comes
unlooked for is more painful than that we may reasonably fear: as
if when expecting to see one's friend basking in prosperity and
admiration, one should hear that he had been put to the torture, as
Parmenio heard about Philotas. And who would say that the anger of
Magas against Philemon was equal to that of Nicocreon against
Anaxarchus? Both Magas and Nicocreon had been insulted, but whereas
Nicocreon brayed Anaxarchus to death with iron pestles and made
mincemeat of him, Magas contented himself with bidding the
executioner lay his naked sword on Philemon's neck, and then let
him go.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a
href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> And so Plato
called anger the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id=
"Page_114">114</a></span>nerves of the mind, since it can be both
intensified by bitterness, and slackened by mildness. To evade
these and similar arguments, they deny that intensity and excess of
passion are according to judgement, wherein is the propensity to
fault, but maintain that they are bites and contractions and
diffusings capable of increase or diminution through the
unreasoning element. And yet it is evident that there are
differences as regards judgements; for some judge poverty to be no
evil, while others judge it to be a great evil, and others again
the very greatest evil, insomuch that they even throw themselves
headlong down rocks and into the sea on account of it. Again as to
death, some think it an evil only in depriving us of good things,
whereas others think it so in regard to eternal punishments and
awful torments in the world below. Health again is valued by some
as natural and advantageous, while to others it seems the greatest
blessing of life, in comparison with which they reckon little
either of wealth or children or "royal power that makes one equal
to the gods," and at last come to think even virtue useless and
unprofitable, if health be absent. Thus it is clear that even with
regard to judgements themselves some err more, some less. But I
shall bring no further proof of this now, but this one may assume
therefrom, that they themselves concede that the unreasoning
element is something different from judgement, in that they allow
that by it passion becomes greater and more violent, and while they
quarrel about the name and word they give up the thing itself to
those who maintain that the emotional and unreasoning part of the
soul is distinct from the reasoning and judging element. And in his
treatise on Anomaly,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id=
"FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class=
"fnanchor">242</a> Chrysippus, after telling us that anger is
blind, and frequently does not let one see what is obvious,
frequently also obscures what we do get a sight of, goes on to say,
"The encroachment of the passions blots out reason, and makes
things look different to what they should look, violently forcing
people on unreasonable acts." And he quotes as witness Menander,
who says, "Alas! <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id=
"Page_115">115</a></span>poor me, wherever were my brains in my
body at the time when I chose that line of conduct, and not this?"
And Chrysippus proceeds, "Though every living creature endowed with
reason is naturally inclined to use reason and to be governed by it
on every occasion, yet often do we reject it, being borne away by a
more violent impulse;" thus admitting what results from the
difference between passion and reason. For otherwise it is
ridiculous, as Plato says, to argue that a man is sometimes better
than himself, sometimes worse, sometimes master of himself,
sometimes not master of himself.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xi.</span> For how is it possible
that the same person can be both better and worse than himself,
both master of himself and not master, unless everyone is in some
way twofold, having in himself both a better and worse self? For so
he that makes the baser element subject to the better has
self-control and is a superior man, whereas he who allows the
nobler element of the soul to follow and be subservient to the
incorrigible and unreasoning element, is inferior to what he might
be, and is called incontinent, and is in an unnatural condition.
For by nature it appertains to reason, which is divine, to rule and
govern the unreasoning element, which has its origin from the body,
which it also naturally resembles and participates in its passions,
being placed in it and mixed up with it, as is proved by the
impulses to bodily delights, which are always fierce or languid
according to the changes of the body. And so it is that young men
are keen and vehement in their desires, being red hot and raging
from their fulness of blood and animal heat, whereas with old men
the liver, which is the seat of desire, is dried up and weak and
feeble, and reason has more power with them than passion which
decays with the body. This principle also no doubt characterizes
the nature of animals as regards the sexual appetite. For it is not
of course from any fitness or unfitness of opinions, that some
animals are so bold and resolute in the presence of danger, while
others are helpless and full of fear and trembling; but this
difference of emotion is produced by the workings of the blood and
spirit and body, the emotional part growing out of the flesh, as
from a root, and carrying along with it its quality and
temperament. And that the body of man<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span> sympathizes with and is
affected by the emotional impulses is proved by pallors, and
blushings, and tremblings, and palpitations of the heart, as on the
other hand by an all-pervading joy in the hope and expectation of
pleasures. But whenever the mind is by itself and unmoved by
passion, the body is in repose and at rest, having no participation
or share in the working of the intellect, unless it involve the
emotional, or the unreasoning element call it in. So that it is
clear that there are two distinct parts of the soul differing from
one another in their faculties.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xii.</span> And generally speaking of
all existing things, as they themselves admit and is clear, some
are governed by nature, some by habit, some by an unreasoning soul,
some by a soul that has reason and intelligence. Man too
participates in all this, and is subject to all those differences
here mentioned, for he is affected by habit, and nourished by
nature, and uses reason and intelligence. He has also a share of
the unreasoning element, and has the principle of passion innate in
him, not as a mere episode in his life but as a necessity, which
ought not therefore to be entirely rooted out, but requires care
and attention. For the function of reason is no Thracian or
Lycurgean one to root up and destroy all the good elements in
passion indiscriminately with the bad, but, as some genial and mild
god, to prune what is wild, and to correct disproportion, and after
that to train and cultivate the useful part. For as those who are
afraid to get drunk do not pour on the ground their wine, <i>but
mix it with water</i>, so those who are afraid of the disturbing
element in passion do not eradicate passion altogether but temper
it. Similarly with oxen and horses people try to restrain their mad
bounds and restiveness, not their movements and powers of work, and
so reason makes use of the passions when they have become tame and
docile, not by cutting out the sinews or altogether mutilating the
serviceable part of the soul. For as Pindar says, "The horse to the
chariot, and the ox to the plough, while he that meditates
destruction for the boar must find a staunch hound."<a name=
"FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> But much more useful
than these are the whole tribe of passions when they wait on reason
and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id=
"Page_117">117</a></span>run parallel to virtue. Thus moderate
anger is useful to courage, and hatred of evil to uprightness, and
righteous indignation against those who are fortunate beyond their
deserts, when they are inflamed in their souls with folly and
insolence and need a check. And no one if they wished could pluck
away or sever<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id=
"FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class=
"fnanchor">244</a> natural affection from friendship, or pity from
philanthropy, or sympathy both in joy and grief from genuine
goodwill. And if those err who wish to banish love because of
erotic madness, neither are they right who blame all desire because
of love of money, but they act like people who refuse to run
because they might stumble, or to throw because they might throw
wide of the mark, or object to sing altogether because they might
make a false note. For as in sounds music does not create melody by
the banishment of sharps and flats, and as in bodies the art of the
physician procures health not by the doing away of cold and heat
but by their being blended in due proportions and quantities, so is
victory won in the soul by the powers and motions of the passions
being reduced by reason to moderation and due proportion. For
excessive grief or fear or joy in the soul (I speak not of mere joy
grief or fear), resembles a body swollen or inflamed. And Homer
when he says excellently,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"The brave man's colour never
changes, nor</span> <span class="i0">Is he much frightened,"<a
name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>does not take away all fear but only excessive fear, that
bravery may not become recklessness, nor confidence foolhardiness.
So also in regard to pleasure we must do away with excessive
desire, and in regard to vengeance with excessive hatred of evil.
For so in the former case one will not be apathetic but temperate,
and in the latter one will not be savage or cruel but just. But if
the passions were entirely removed, supposing that to be possible,
reason would become in many duller and blunter, like the pilot in
the absence of a storm. And no doubt it is from having noticed this
that legislators try to excite in states ambition and emulation
among their townsmen, and stir up and increase their courage and
pugnacity against enemies <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118"
id="Page_118">118</a></span>by the sound of trumpets and flutes.
For it is not only in poems, as Plato says, that he that is
inspired by the Muses, and as it were possessed by them, will laugh
to shame the plodding artist, but also in fighting battles passion
and enthusiasm will be irresistible and invincible, such as Homer
makes the gods inspire men with, as in the line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Thus speaking he infused
great might in Hector,</span> <span class="i0">The shepherd of the
people."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a
href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>and,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"He is not mad like this

</div>

<p>as if the god had added passion to reason as an incitement and
spur. And you may see those very persons, whose opinions I am
combating, frequently urging on the young by praises, and
frequently checking them by rebukes, though pleasure follows the
one, pain the other. For rebukes and censure produce repentance and
shame, the one bringing grief, the other fear, and these they
mostly make use of for purposes of correction. And so Diogenes,
when Plato was being praised, said, "What has he to vaunt of, who
has been a philosopher so long, and yet never gave pain to anyone?"
For one could not say, to use the words of Xenocrates, that the
mathematics are such handles to philosophy as are the emotions of
young men, such as shame, desire, repentance, pleasure, pain,
ambition, whereon reason and the law laying a suitable grip succeed
in putting the young man on the right road. So that it was no bad
remark of the Laced&aelig;monian tutor, that he would make the boy
entrusted to his charge pleased with what was good and displeased
with what was bad,<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id=

<h3><a name="Page_118a" id="Page_118a">HOW ONE MAY BE AWARE OF
ONE'S PROGRESS IN VIRTUE.</a></h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> What amount of argument,
Sossius Senecio, will make a man know that he is improving in
respect to virtue, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id=
"Page_119">119</a></span>if his advances in it do not bring about
some diminution in folly, but vice, weighing equally with all his
good intentions, "acts like the lead that makes the net go down?"<a
name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> For neither in music
nor grammatical knowledge could anyone recognize any improvement,
if he remained as unskilful in them as before, and had not lost
some of his old ignorance. Nor in the case of anyone ill would
medical treatment, if it brought no relief or ease, by the disease
somewhat yielding and abating, give any perception of improvement
of health, till the opposite condition was completely brought about
by the body recovering its full strength. But just as in these
cases there is no improvement unless, by the abatement of what
weighs them down till they rise in the opposite scale, they
recognize a change, so in the case of those who profess philosophy
no improvement or sign of improvement can be supposed, unless the
soul lay aside and purge itself of some of its imperfection, and if
it continue altogether bad until it become absolutely good and
perfect. For indeed a wise man cannot in a moment of time change
from absolute badness to perfect goodness, and suddenly abandon for
ever all that vice, of which he could not during a long period of
time divest himself of any portion. And yet you know, of course,
that those who maintain these views frequently give themselves much
trouble and bewilderment about the difficulty, that a wise man does
not perceive that he has become wise, but is ignorant and doubtful
that in a long period of time by little and little, by removing
some things and adding others, there will be a secret and quiet
improvement, and as it were passage to virtue. But if the change
were so great and sudden that the worst man in the morning could
become the best man at night, or should the change so happen that
he went to bed vicious and woke up in the morning wise, and, having
dismissed from his mind all yesterday's follies and errors, should
say,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"False dreams, away, you had

</div>

<p>who on earth could be ignorant of so great a change happening to
himself, of virtue blazing forth so completely <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>all at
once? I myself am of opinion that anyone, like Caeneus,<a name=
"FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> who, according, to his
prayer, got changed from a woman into a man, would sooner be
ignorant of the transformation, than that a man should become at
once, from a cowardly and senseless person with no powers of
self-control, brave and sensible and perfect master of himself, and
should in a moment change from a brutish life to a divine without
being aware of it.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> That was an excellent
observation, Measure the stone by the mason's rule, not the rule by
the stone.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a
href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> But the Stoics,
not applying dogmas to facts but facts to their own preconceived
opinions, and forcing things to agree that do not by nature, have
filled philosophy with many difficulties, the greatest of which is
that all men but the perfect man are equally vicious, which has
produced the enigma called progress, one little short of extreme
folly, since it makes those who have not at once under its guidance
given up all passions and disorders equally unfortunate as those
who have not got rid of a single vile propensity. However they are
their own confuters, for while they lay down in the schools that
Aristides was as unjust as Phalaris, and Brasidas as great a craven
as Dolon, and Plato actually as senseless as Meletus, in life and
its affairs they turn away from and avoid one class as implacable,
while they make use of the others and trust them in most important
matters as most worthy people.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> But we who see that in
every kind of evil, but especially in a disordered and unsettled
state of mind, there are degrees of more and less (so that the
progress made differs in different cases, badness abating, as a
shadow flees away, under the influence of reason, which calmly
illuminates and cleanses the soul), cannot consider it unreasonable
to think that the change will be perceived, as people who come up
out of some ravine can take note of the progress they make upwards.
Look at the case from the following point of view first. Just as
mariners sailing with full sail over the gaping<a name=
"FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> ocean measure the
course <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id=
"Page_121">121</a></span>they have made by the time they have taken
and the force of the wind, and compute their progress accordingly,
so anyone can compute his progress in philosophy by his continuous
and unceasing course, by his not making many halts on the road, and
then again advancing by leaps and bounds, but by his quiet and even
and steady march forward guided by reason. For the words of the
poet, "If to a little you keep adding a little, and do so
frequently, <i>it will soon be a lot</i>,"<a name=
"FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> are not only true of
the increase of money, but are universally applicable, and
especially to increase in virtue, since reason invokes to her aid
the enormous force of habit. On the other hand the inconsistencies
and dulnesses of some philosophers not only check advance, as it
were, on the road, but even break up the journey altogether, since
vice always attacks at its leisure and forces back whatever yields
to it.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> The mathematicians
tell us that planets, after completing their course, become
stationary; but in philosophy there is no such intermission or
stationary position from the cessation of progress, for its nature
is ever to be moving and, as it were, to be weighed in the scales,
sometimes being overweighted by the good preponderating, sometimes
by the bad. If, therefore, imitating the oracle given to the
Amphictyones by the god, "to fight against the people of Cirrha
every day and every night,"<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id=
"FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class=
"fnanchor">256</a> you are conscious that night and day you ever
maintain a fierce fight against vice, not often relaxing your
vigilance, or long off your guard, or receiving as heralds to treat
of peace<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a
href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> the pleasures, or
idleness, or stress of business, you may reasonably go forward to
the future courageously and confidently.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Moreover, if there be any
intermissions in philosophy, and yet your later studies are firmer
and more continuous than your former ones, it is no bad indication
that your sloth has been expelled by labour and exercise; for the
contrary is a bad sign, when after a short time your lapses <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>from
zeal become many and continuous, as if your zeal were dying away.
For as in the growth of a reed, which shoots up from the ground
finely and beautifully to an even and continuous height, though at
first from its great intervals it is hindered and baffled in its
growth, and afterwards through its weakness is discouraged by any
breath of air, and though strengthened by many and frequent joints,
yet a violent wind gives it commotion and trembling, so those who
at first make great launches out into philosophy, and afterwards
find that they are continually hindered and baffled, and cannot
perceive that they make any progress, finally get tired of it and
cry off. "But he who is as it were winged,"<a name=
"FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> is by his simplicity
borne along to his end, and by his zeal and energy cuts through
impediments to his progress, as merely obstacles on the road. As it
is a sign of the growth of violent love, not so much to rejoice in
the presence of the loved one, for everyone does that, as to be
distressed and grieved at his absence,<a name="FNanchor_259_259"
id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class=
"fnanchor">259</a> so many feel a liking for philosophy and seem to
take a wonderful interest in the study, but if they are diverted by
other matters and business their passion evaporates and they take
it very easily. "But whoever is strongly smitten with love for his
darling"<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a
href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> will show his
mildness and agreeableness in the presence of and joint pursuit of
wisdom with the loved one, but if he is drawn away from him and is
not in his company you will see him in a stew and ill at ease and
peevish whether at work or leisure, and unreasonably forgetful of
his friends, and wholly impelled by his passion for philosophy. For
we ought not to rejoice at discourses only when we hear them, as
people like perfumes only when they smell them, and not to seek or
care about them in their absence, but in the same condition as
people who are hungry and thirsty are in if torn away from food and
drink, we ought to follow after true proficiency in philosophy,
whether marriage, or wealth, or friendship, or military service,
strike in and produce a separation. For just as more <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>is to be
got from philosophy, so much the more does what we fail to obtain
trouble us.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> Either precisely the same
as this or very similar is Hesiod's<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id=
"FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class=
"fnanchor">261</a> very ancient definition of progress in virtue,
namely, that the road is no longer very steep or arduous, but easy
and smooth and level, its roughness being toned down by exercise,
and casting the bright light of philosophy on doubt and error and
regrets, such as trouble those who give themselves to philosophy at
the outset, like people who leave a land they know, and do not yet
descry the land they are sailing to. For by abandoning the common
and familiar, before they know and apprehend what is better, they
frequently flounder about in the middle and are fain to return. As
they say the Roman Sextius, giving up for philosophy all his
honours and offices in Rome, being afterwards discontented with
philosophy from the difficulties he met with in it at first, very
nearly threw himself out of window. Similarly they relate of
Diogenes of Sinope,<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id=
"FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class=
"fnanchor">262</a> when he began to be a philosopher, that the
Athenians were celebrating a festival, and there were public
banquets and shows and mutual festivities, and drinking and
revelling all night, and he, coiled up in a corner of the
market-place intending to sleep, fell into a train of thought
likely seriously to turn him from his purpose and shake his
resolution, for he reflected that he had adopted without any
necessity a toilsome and unusual kind of life, and by his own fault
sat there debarred of all the good things. At that moment, however,
they say a mouse stole up and began to munch some of the crumbs of
his barley-cake, and he plucked up his courage and said to himself,
in a railing and chiding fashion, "What say you, Diogenes? Do your
leavings give this mouse a sumptuous meal, while you, the
gentleman, wail and lament because you are not getting drunk yonder
and reclining on soft and luxurious couches?" Whenever such
depressions of mind are not frequent, and the mind when they take
place quickly recovers from them, after having put them to flight
as it were, and when such annoyance and distraction is easily <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>got
rid of, then one may consider one's progress in virtue as a
certainty.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> And since not only the
things that in themselves shake and turn them in the opposite
direction are more powerful in the case of weak philosophers, but
also the serious advice of friends, and the playful and jeering
objections of adversaries bend and soften people, and have ere now
shaken some out of philosophy altogether, it will be no slight
indication of one's progress in virtue if one takes all this very
calmly, and is neither disturbed nor aggravated by people who tell
us and mention to us that some of our former comrades are
flourishing in kings' courts, or have married wives with dowries,
or are attended by a crowd of friends when they come down to the
forum to solicit some office or advocateship. He that is not moved
or affected by all this is already plainly one upon whom philosophy
has got a right hold; for it is impossible that we should cease to
be envious of what most people admire, unless the admiration of
virtue was strongly implanted in us. For over-confidence may be
generated in some by anger and folly, but to despise what men
admire is not possible without a true and steady elevation of mind.
And so people in such a condition of mind, comparing it with that
of others, pride themselves on it, and say with Solon, "We would
not change virtue for wealth, for while virtue abides, wealth
changes hands, and now one man, now another, has it."<a name=
"FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> And Diogenes compared
his shifting about from Corinth to Athens, and again from Thebes to
Corinth, to the different residences of the King of Persia, as his
spring residence at Susa, his winter residence at Babylon, and his
summer residence in Media. And Agesilaus said of the great king,
"How is he better than me, if he is not more upright?" And
Aristotle, writing to Antipater about Alexander, said, "that he
ought not to think highly of himself because he had many subjects,
for anyone who had right notions about the gods was entitled to
think quite as highly of himself." And Zeno, observing that
Theophrastus was admired for the number of his pupils,<a name=
"FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> said, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>"His choir
is, I admit, larger than mine, but mine is more harmonious."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> Whenever then, by thus
comparing the advantages of virtue with external things, you get
rid of envies and jealousies and those things which fret and
depress the minds of many who are novices in philosophy, this also
is a great indication of your progress in virtue. Another and no
slight indication is a change in the style of your discourses. For
generally speaking all novices in philosophy adopt most such as
tend to their own glorification; some, like birds, in their levity
and ambition soaring to the height and brightness of physical
things; others like young puppies, as Plato<a name=
"FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> says, rejoicing in
tearing and biting, betake themselves to strifes and questions and
sophisms; but most plunging themselves into dialectics immediately
store themselves for sophistry; and some collect sentences<a name=
"FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> and histories and go
about (as Anacharsis said he saw the Greeks used money for no other
purpose but to count it up), merely piling up and comparing them,
but making no practical use of them. Applicable here is that saying
of Antiphanes, which someone applied to Plato's pupils. Antiphanes
said playfully that in a certain city words were frozen directly
they were spoken, owing to the great cold, and were thawed again in
the summer, so that one could then hear what had been said in the
winter. So he said of the words which were spoken by Plato to young
men, that most of them only understood them late in life when they
were become old men. And this is the condition people are in in
respect to all philosophy, until the judgement gets into a sound
and healthy state, and begins to adapt itself to those things which
can produce character and greatness of mind, and to seek discourses
whose footsteps turn inwards rather than outwards, to borrow the
language of &AElig;sop.<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id=
"FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class=
"fnanchor">267</a> For as Sophocles said he had first toned down
the pompous style of &AElig;schylus, then his harsh and
over-artificial method, and had in the third <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>place
changed his manner of diction, a most important point and one that
is most intimately connected with the character, so those who go in
for philosophy, when they have passed from flattering and
artificial discourses to such as deal with character and emotion,
are beginning to make genuine and modest progress in virtue.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> Furthermore, take care,
in reading the writings of philosophers or hearing their speeches,
that you do not attend to words more than things, nor get attracted
more by what is difficult and curious than by what is serviceable
and solid and useful. And also, in studying poems or history, let
nothing escape you of what is said to the point, which is likely
either to correct the character or to calm the passions. For as
Simonides says the bee hovers among the flowers "making the yellow
honey,"<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a
href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> while others
value and pluck flowers only for their beauty and fragrance, so of
all that read poems for pleasure and amusement he alone that finds
and gathers what is valuable seems capable of knowledge from his
acquaintance with and friendship for what is noble and good.<a
name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> For those who study
Plato and Xenophon only for their style, and cull out only what is
pure and Attic, and as it were the dew and the bloom, do they not
resemble people who love drugs for their smell and colour, but care
not for them as anodynes or purges, and are not aware of those
properties? Whereas those who have more proficiency can derive
benefit not from discourses only, but from sights and actions, and
cull what is good and useful, as is recorded of &AElig;schylus and
other similar kind of men. As to &AElig;schylus, when he was
watching a contest in boxing at the Isthmus, and the whole theatre
cried out upon one of the boxers being beaten, he nudged with his
elbow Ion of Chios, and said, "Do you observe the power of
training? The beaten man holds his peace, while the spectators cry
out." And Brasidas having caught hold of a mouse among some figs,
being bitten by it let it go, and said to himself, "Hercules, there
is no creature so small or weak that it will not fight for its
life!" <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id=
"Page_127">127</a></span>And Diogenes, seeing a lad drinking water
out of the palm of his hand, threw away the cup which he kept in
his wallet. So much does attention and assiduous practice make
people perceptive and receptive of what contributes to virtue from
any source. And this is the case still more with those who mix
discourses with actions, who not only, to use the language of
Thucydides,<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a
href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> "exercise
themselves in the presence of danger," but also in regard to
pleasures and strifes, and judgements, and advocateships, and
magistrateships make a display of their opinions, or rather form
their opinions by their practice. For we can no more think those
philosophers who are ever learning and busy and investigating what
they have got from philosophy, and then straightway publish it in
the market-place or in the haunt of young men, or at a royal
supper-party, any more than we give the name of physicians to those
who sell drugs and mixtures. Nay rather such a sophist differs very
little at all from the bird described in Homer,<a name=
"FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> offering his scholars
like it whatever he has got, and as it feeds its callow young from
its own mouth, "though it goes ill with itself," so he gets no
advantage or food from what he has got for himself.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> We must therefore see to
it that our discourse be serviceable to ourselves, and that it may
not appear to others to be vain-glorious or ambitious, and we must
show that we are as willing to listen as to teach, and especially
must we lay aside all disputatiousness and love of strife in
controversy, and cease bandying fierce words with one another as if
we were contending with one another at boxing, and leave off
rejoicing more in smiting and knocking down one another than in
learning and teaching. For in such cases moderation and mildness,
and to commence arguing without quarrelsomeness and to finish
without getting into a rage, and neither to be insolent if you come
off best in the argument, nor dejected if you come off worst, is a
sufficient sign of progress in virtue. Aristippus was an excellent
example of this, when overcome in argument by the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>sophistry
of a man, who had plenty of assurance, but was generally speaking
mad or half-witted. Observing that he was in great joy and very
puffed up at his victory, he said, "I who have been vanquished in
the argument shall have a better night's rest than my victor." We
can also test ourselves in regard to public speaking, if we are not
timid and do not shrink from speaking when a large audience has
unexpectedly been got together, nor dejected when we have only a
small one to harangue to, and if we do not, when we have to speak
to the people or before some magistrate, miss the opportunity
through want of proper preparation; for these things are recorded
both of Demosthenes and Alcibiades. As for Alcibiades, though he
possessed a most excellent understanding, yet from want of
confidence in speaking he often broke down, and in trying to recall
a word or thought that slipped his memory had to stop short.<a
name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> And Homer did not deny
that his first line was unmetrical,<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id=
"FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class=
"fnanchor">273</a> though he had sufficient confidence to follow it
up by so many other lines, so great was his genius. Much more then
ought those who aim at virtue and what is noble to lose no
opportunity of public speaking, paying very little attention to
either uproar or applause at their speeches.</p>

<p><a name="Page_128a" id="Page_128a" />&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> And not only ought each to
see to his discourses but also to his actions whether he regards
utility more than show, and truth more than display. For if a
genuine love for youth or maiden seeks no witnesses, but is content
to enjoy its delights privately, far more does it become the
philosopher and lover of the beautiful, who is conversant with
virtue through his actions, to pride himself on his silence, and
not to need people to praise or listen to him. As that man who
called his maid in the house, and cried out to her, "See, Dionysia,
I am angry no longer,"<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id=
"FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class=
"fnanchor">274</a> so he that does anything agreeable and polite,
and then goes and spreads it about the town, plainly shows that he
looks for public applause and has a strong propensity to
vain-glory, and as yet has no acquaintance with virtue as a reality
but only as a dream, restlessly roving about amid <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>phantoms
and shadows, and making a display of whatever he does as painters
display a picture. It is therefore a sign of progress in virtue not
merely to have given to a friend or done a good turn to an
acquaintance without mentioning it to other people, but also to
have given an honest vote among many unjust ones, and to have
withstood the dishonourable request of some rich man or of some man
in office, and to have been above taking bribes, and, by Zeus, to
have been thirsty all night and not to have drunk, or, like
Agesilaus,<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a
href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> to have resisted,
though strongly tempted, the kiss of a handsome youth or maiden,
and to have kept the fact to oneself and been silent about it. For
one's being satisfied with one's own good opinion<a name=
"FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> and not despising it,
but rejoicing in it and acquiescing in it as competent to see and
decide on what is honourable, proves that reason is rooted and
grounded within one, and that, to borrow the language of
Democritus, one is accustomed to draw one's delights from oneself.
And just as farmers behold with greater pleasure those ears of corn
which bend and bow down to the ground, while they look upon those
that from their lightness stand straight upright as empty
pretenders, so also among those young men who wish to be
philosophers those that are most empty and without any solidity
show the greatest amount of assurance in their appearance and walk,
and a face full of haughtiness and contempt that looks down on
everybody, but when they begin to grow full and get some fruit from
study they lay aside their proud and vain<a name="FNanchor_277_277"
id="FNanchor_277_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_277" class=
"fnanchor">277</a> bearing. And just as in vessels that contain
water the air is excluded, so with men that are full of solid merit
their pride abates, and their estimate of themselves becomes a
lower one, and they cease to plume themselves on a long beard and
threadbare cloak,<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id=
"FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class=
"fnanchor">278</a> and transfer their training to the mind, and are
most severe and austere to themselves, while they are milder in
their intercourse with everybody else; and they do not as before
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id=
"Page_130">130</a></span>eagerly snatch at the name and reputation
of philosopher, nor do they write themselves down as such, but even
if he were addressed by that title by anyone else, an ingenuous
young man would say, smiling and blushing, "I am not a god: why do
you liken me to the immortals?"<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id=
"FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class=

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I never can mistake the
burning eye</span> <span class="i0">Of the young woman that has

<p>so to the young man who has tasted of true progress in
philosophy the following lines of Sappho are applicable, "My tongue
cleaves to the roof of my month, and a fire courses all over my
lean body," and his eye will be gentle and mild, and you would
desire to hear him speak. For as those who are initiated come
together at first with confusion and noise and jostle one another,
but when the mysteries are being performed and exhibited, they give
their attention with awe and silence, so also at the commencement
of philosophy you will see round its doors much confusion and
assurance and prating, some rudely and violently jostling their way
to reputation, but he who once enters in, and sees the great light,
as when shrines are open to view, assumes another air and is silent
and awe-struck, and in humility and decorum follows reason as if
she were a god. And the playful remark of Menedemus seems to suit
these very well. He said that the majority of those who went to
school at Athens became first wise, and then philosophers, after
that orators, and as time went on became ordinary kind of people,
the more they had to do with learning, so much the more laying
aside their pride and high estimate of themselves.</p>

<p><a name="Page_130a" id=

help of the physician some, if their tooth ache or even finger
smart, run at once to the doctor, others if they are feverish send
for one and implore his assistance at their own home, others who
are melancholy or crazy or delirious will not sometimes even see
the doctor if he comes to their house, but drive him away, or avoid
him, ignorant through their grievous disease that they are diseased
at all. Similarly of those who have done
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
what is wrong some are
incorrigible, being hostile and indignant and furious at those who
reprove and admonish them, while others are meeker and bear and
allow reproof. Now, when one has done what is wrong, to offer
oneself for reproof, to expose the case and reveal one's
wrongdoing, and not to rejoice if it lies hid, or be satisfied if
it is not known, but to make confession of it and ask for
interference and admonishment, is no small indication of progress
in virtue. And so Diogenes said that one who wished to do what was
right ought to seek either a good friend or red-hot enemy, that
either by rebuke or mild entreaty he might flee from vice. But as
long as anyone, making a display of dirt or stains on his clothes,
or a torn shoe, prides himself to outsiders on his freedom from
arrogance, and, by Zeus, thinks himself doing something very smart
if he jeers at himself as a dwarf or hunchback, but wraps up and
conceals as if they were ulcers the inner vileness of his soul and
the deformities of his life, as his envy, his malignity, his
littleness, his love of pleasure, and will not let anyone touch or
look at them from fear of disgrace, such a one has made little
progress in virtue, yea rather none. But he that joins issue with
his vices, and shows that he himself is even more pained and
grieved about them than anyone else, or, what is next best, is able
and willing to listen patiently to the reproof of another and to
correct his life accordingly, he seems truly to be disgusted at his
depravity and resolute to divest himself of it. We ought certainly
to be ashamed of and shun every appearance of vice, but he who is
more put about by his vice itself than by the bad reputation that
ensues upon it, will not mind either hearing it spoken against or
even speaking against it himself if it make him a better man. That
was a witty remark of Diogenes to a young man, who when seen in a
tavern retired into the kitchen: "The more," said he, "you retire,
the more are you in the tavern."<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id=
"FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class=
"fnanchor">281</a> Even so the more a vicious man denies his vice,
the more does it <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id=
"Page_132">132</a></span>insinuate itself and master him: as those
people really poor who pretend to be rich get still more poor from
their false display. But he who is really making progress in virtue
imitates Hippocrates, who confessed publicly and put into black and
white that he had made a mistake about the sutures of the skull,<a
name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> for he will think it
monstrous, if that great man declared his mistake, that others
might not fall into the same error, and yet he himself for his own
deliverance from vice cannot bear to be shown he is in the wrong,
and to confess his stupidity and ignorance. Moreover the sayings of
Bion and Pyrrho will test not so much one's progress as a greater
and more perfect habit of virtue. Bion maintained that his friends
might think they had made progress, when they could listen as
patiently to abuse as to such language as the following, "Stranger,
you look not like a bad or foolish person,"<a name=
"FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> "Health and joy go
with you, may the gods give you happiness!"<a name=
"FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> While as to Pyrrho
they say, when he was at sea and in peril from a storm, that he
pointed out a little pig that was quietly enjoying some grain that
had been scattered about, and said to his companions that the man
who did not wish to be disturbed by the changes and chances of life
should attain a similar composedness of mind through reason and
philosophy.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xii.</span> Look also at the opinion
of Zeno, who thought that everybody might gauge his progress in
virtue by his dreams, if he saw himself in his dreams pleasing
himself with nothing disgraceful, and neither doing nor wishing to
do anything dreadful or unjust, but that, as in the clear depths of
a calm and tranquil sea, his fancy and passions were plainly shown
to be under the control of reason. And this had not escaped the
notice of Plato,<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id=
"FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class=
"fnanchor">285</a> it seems, who had earlier expressed in form and
outline the part that fancy and unreason played in sleep in the
soul that was by nature tyrannical, "for it attempts incest," he
says, "with its mother, and procures for itself unlawful meats, and
gives <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id=
"Page_133">133</a></span>itself up to the most abandoned desires,
such as in daytime the law through shame and fear debars people
from." As then beasts of burden that have been well-trained do not,
even if their driver let go the reins, attempt to turn aside and
leave the proper road, but go forward orderly as usual, pursuing
their way without stumbling, so those whose unreason has become
obedient and mild and tempered by reason, will not easily wish,
either in dreams or in illnesses, to deal insolently or lawlessly
through their desires, but will keep to their usual habits, which
acquire their power and force by attention. For if the body can by
training make itself and its members so subject to control, that
the eyes in sorrow can refrain from tears, and the heart from
palpitating in fear, and the passions can be calm in the presence
of beautiful youths and maidens, is it not far more likely that the
training of the passions and emotions of the soul will allay, tame
down, and mould their propensities even in dreams? A story is told
about the philosopher Stilpo,<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id=
"FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class=
"fnanchor">286</a> that he thought he saw in a dream Poseidon angry
with him because he had not sacrificed an ox to him, as was usual
among the Megarians:<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id=
"FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class=
"fnanchor">287</a> and that he, not a bit frightened, said, "What
are you talking about, Poseidon? Do you come here as a peevish boy,
because I have not with borrowed money filled the town with the
smell of sacrifice, and have only sacrificed to you out of what I
had at home on a modest scale?" Then he thought that Poseidon
smiled at him, and held out his right hand, and said that for his
sake he would give the Megarians a large shoal of anchovies. Those,
then, that have such pleasant, clear, and painless dreams, and no
frightful, or harsh, or malignant, or untoward apparition, may be
said to have reflections of their progress in virtue; whereas
agitation and panics and ignoble flights, and boyish delights, and
lamentations in the case of sad and strange dreams, are like the
waves that break on the coast, the soul not having yet got its
proper composure, but being still in course of being moulded by
opinions and laws, from which it escapes in dreams as far <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>as
possible, so that it is once again set free and open to the
passions. Do you investigate all these points too, as to whether
they are signs of progress in virtue, or of some habit which has
already a settled constancy and strength through reason.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> Now since entire freedom
from the passions is a great and divine thing, and progress in
virtue seems, as we say, to consist in a certain remissness and
mildness of the passions, we must observe the passions both in
themselves and in reference to one another to gauge the difference:
in themselves as to whether desire, and fear, and rage are less
strong in us now than formerly, through our quickly extinguishing
their violence and heat by reason; and in reference to one another
as to whether we are animated now by modesty more than by fear, and
by emulation more than by envy, and by love of glory rather than by
love of riches, and generally speaking whether&mdash;to use the
language of musicians&mdash;it is in the Dorian more than in the
Lydian measures that we err either by excess or deficiency,<a name=
"FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> whether we are plainer
in our manner of living or more luxurious, whether we are slower in
action or quicker, whether we admire men and their discourses more
than we should or despise them. For as it is a good sign in
diseases if they turn aside from vital parts of the body, so in the
case of people who are making progress in virtue, when vice seems
to shift to milder passions, it is a sign it will soon die out.
When Phrynis added to the seven chords two chords more, the Ephors
asked him which he preferred to let them cut off, the upper or
lower ones;<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a
href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> so we must cut
off both above and below, if we mean to attain, to the mean and to
due proportion: for progress in virtue first diminishes the excess
and sharpness of the passions,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"That sharpness for which
madmen are so vehement,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>as Sophocles says.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> I have already said that
it is a very great indication of progress in virtue to transfer our
judgement to action, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id=
"Page_135">135</a></span>and not to let our words remain merely
words, but to make deeds of them. A manifestation of this is in the
first place emulation as regards what we praise, and a zeal to do
what we admire, and an unwillingness either to do or allow what we
censure. To illustrate my meaning by an example, it is probable
that all Athenians praised the daring and bravery of Miltiades; but
Themistocles alone said that the trophy of Miltiades would not let
him sleep, but woke him up of a night, and not only praised and
admired him, but manifestly emulated and imitated his glorious
actions. Small, therefore, can we think the progress we have made,
as long as our admiration for those who have done noble things is
barren, and does not of itself incite us to imitate them. For as
there is no strong love without jealousy, so there is no ardent and
energetic praise of virtue, which does not prick and goad one on,
and make one not envious but emulous of what is noble, and desirous
to do something similar. For not only at the discourses of a
philosopher ought we, as Alcibiades said,<a name="FNanchor_290_290"
id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class=
"fnanchor">290</a> to be moved in heart and shed tears, but the
true proficient in virtue, comparing his own deeds and actions with
those of the good and perfect man, and grieved at the same time at
the knowledge of his own deficiency, yet rejoicing in hope and
desire, and full of impulses that will not let him rest, is, as
Simonides says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Like sucking foal running by
side of dam,"<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id=
"FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class=

</div>

<p>being desirous all but to coalesce with the good man. For it is
a special sign of true progress in virtue to love and admire the
disposition of those whose deeds we emulate, and to resemble them
with a goodwill that ever assigns due honour and praise to them.
But whoever is steeped in contentiousness and envy against his
betters, let him know that he may be pricked on by a jealous desire
for glory or power, but that he neither honours nor admires
virtue.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> Whenever, then, we begin
so much to love good men that we deem happy, "not only," as Plato<a
name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> says, "the temperate
man himself, but also the man who hears <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>the words that flow
from his wise lips," and even admire and are pleased with his
figure and walk and look and smile, and desire to adapt ourselves
to his model and to stick closely to him, then may we think that we
are making genuine progress. Still more will this be the case, if
we admire the good not only in prosperity, but like lovers who
admire even the lispings and paleness of those in their flower,<a
name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> as the tears and
dejection of Panthea in her grief and affliction won the affections
of Araspes,<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a
href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> so we fear
neither the exile of Aristides, nor the prison of Anaxagoras, nor
the poverty of Socrates, nor the condemnation of Phocion, but think
virtue worthy our love even under such trials, and join her, ever
chanting that line of Euripides,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Unto the noble everything is
good."<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href=

</div>

<p>For the enthusiasm that can go so far as not to be discouraged
at the sure prospect of trouble, but admires and emulates what is
good even so, could never be turned away from what is noble by
anybody. Such men ever, whether they have some business to
transact, or have taken upon them some office, or are in some
critical conjuncture, put before their eyes the example of noble
men, and consider what Plato would have done on the occasion, what
Epaminondas would have said, how Lycurgus or Agesilaus would have
dealt; that so, adjusting and re-modelling themselves, as it were,
at their mirrors, they may correct any ignoble expression, and
repress any ignoble passion. For as those that have learnt the
names of the Id&aelig;an Dactyli<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id=
"FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class=
"fnanchor">296</a> make use of them to banish their fear by quietly
repeating them over, so the bearing in mind and remembering good
men, which soon suggests itself forcibly to those who have made
some progress in virtue in all their emotions and difficulties,
keeps them upright and not liable to fall. Let this also then be a
sign to you of progress in virtue.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> In addition to this, not
to be too much disturbed, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137"
id="Page_137">137</a></span>nor to blush, nor to try and conceal
oneself, or make any change in one's dress, on the sudden
appearance of a man of distinction and virtue, but to feel
confident and go and meet such a one, is the confirmation of a good
conscience. It is reported that Alexander, seeing a messenger
running up to him full of joy and holding out his right hand, said,
"My good friend, what are you going to tell me? Has Homer come to
life again?" For he thought that his own exploits required nothing
but posthumous fame.<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id=
"FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class=
"fnanchor">297</a> And a young man improving in character
instinctively loves nothing better than to take pride and pleasure
in the company of good and noble men, and to display his house, his
table, his wife, his amusements, his serious pursuits, his spoken
or written discourses; insomuch that he is grieved when he
remembers that his father or guardian died without seeing him in
that condition in life, and would pray for nothing from the gods so
much, as that they could come to life again, and be spectators of
his life and actions; as, on the contrary, those that have
neglected their affairs, and come to ruin, cannot look upon their
relatives even in dreams without fear and trembling.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvii.</span> Add, if you please, to
what I have already said, as no small indication of progress in

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> Vice has universally an
ill effect on everybody, being in itself a sufficient producer of
infelicity, needing no instruments nor ministers. For tyrants,
anxious to make those whom they punish wretched, keep executioners
and torturers, and contrive branding-irons and other instruments of
torture to inspire fear<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id=

without any such apparatus, and crushes and dejects it, and fills a
man with sorrow, and lamentation, and melancholy, and remorse. Here
is a proof of what I say. Many are silent under mutilation, and
endure scourging or torture at the hand of despots or tyrants
without uttering a word, whenever their soul, abating the pain by
reason, forcibly as it were checks and represses them: but you can
never quiet anger or smother grief, or persuade a timid person not
to run away, or one suffering from remorse not to cry out, nor tear
his hair, nor smite his thigh. Thus vice is stronger than fire and
sword.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> You know of course that
cities, when they desire to publicly contract for the building of
temples or colossuses, listen to the estimates of the contractors
who compete for the job, and bring their plans and charges, and
finally select the contractor who will do the work at least <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id=
"Page_140">140</a></span>expense, and best, and quickest. Let us
suppose then that we publicly contract to make the life of man
miserable, and take the estimates of Fortune and Vice for this
object. Fortune shall come forward, provided with all sorts of
instruments and costly apparatus to make life miserable and
wretched. She shall come with robberies and wars, and the
blood-guiltiness of tyrants, and storms at sea, and lightning drawn
down from the sky, she shall compound hemlock, she shall bring
swords, she shall levy an army of informers, she shall cause fevers
to break out, she shall rattle fetters and build prisons. It is
true that most of these things are owing to Vice rather than
Fortune, but let us suppose them all to come from Fortune. And let
Vice stand by naked, without any external things against man, and
let her ask Fortune how she will make man unhappy and dejected.
Fortune, dost thou threaten poverty? Metrocles laughs at thee, who
sleeps during winter among the sheep, in summer in the vestibules
of temples, and challenges the king of the Persians,<a name=
"FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> who winters at
Babylon, and summers in Media, to vie with him in happiness. Dost
thou bring slavery, and bondage, and sale? Diogenes despises thee,
who cried out, as he was being sold by some robbers, "Who will buy
a master?" Dost thou mix a cup of poison? Didst not thou offer such
a one to Socrates? And cheerfully, and mildly, without fear,
without changing colour or countenance, he calmly drank it up: and
when he was dead, all who survived deemed him happy, as sure to
have a divine lot in Hades. And as to thy fire, did not Decius, the
general of the Romans, anticipate it for himself, having piled up a
funeral pyre between the two armies, and sacrificed himself to
Cronos, dedicating himself for the supremacy of his country? And
the chaste and loving wives of the Indians strive and contend with
one another for the fire, and she that wins the day and gets burnt
with the body of her husband, is pronounced happy by the rest, and
her praises sung. And of the wise men in that part of the world no
one is esteemed or pronounced happy, who does not in his <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id=
"Page_141">141</a></span>lifetime, in good health and in full
possession of all his faculties, separate soul from body by fire,
and emerge pure from flesh, having purged away his mortal part. Or
wilt thou reduce a man from a splendid property, and house, and
table, and sumptuous living, to a threadbare coat and wallet, and
begging of daily bread? Such was the beginning of happiness to
Diogenes, of freedom and glory to Crates. Or wilt thou nail a man
on a cross, or impale him on a stake? What cares Theodorus whether
he rots above ground or below? Such was the happy mode of burial
amongst the Scythians,<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id=
"FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class=
"fnanchor">311</a> and among the Hyrcanians dogs, among the
Bactrians birds, devour according to the laws the dead bodies of
those who have made a happy end.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Who then are made unhappy
by these things? Those who have no manliness or reason, the
enervated and untrained, who retain the opinions they had as
children. Fortune therefore does not produce perfect infelicity,
unless Vice co-operate. For as a thread saws through a bone that
has been soaked in ashes and vinegar, and as people bend and
fashion ivory only when it has been made soft and supple by beer,
and cannot under any other circumstances, so Fortune, lighting upon
what is in itself faulty and soft through Vice, hollows it out and
wounds it. And as the Parthian juice, though hurtful to no one else
nor injurious to those who touch it or carry it about, yet if it be
communicated to a wounded man straightway kills him through his
previous susceptibility to receive its essence, so he who will be
upset in soul by Fortune must have some secret internal ulcer or
sore to make external things so piteous and lamentable.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> Does then Vice need Fortune
to bring about infelicity? By no means. She lashes not up the rough
and stormy sea, she girds not lonely mountain passes with robbers
lying in wait by the way, she makes not clouds of hail to burst on
the fruitful plains, she suborns not Meletus or Anytus or
Callixenus as accusers, she takes not away wealth, excludes not
people from the pr&aelig;torship to make them wretched; but she
scares the rich, the well-to-do, and great heirs; by land and sea
she insinuates herself and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142"

inflaming with anger, afflicting them with superstitious fears,
tearing them in pieces with envy.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_142a" id="Page_142a" />WHETHER THE DISORDERS OF
MIND OR BODY ARE WORSE.</h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Homer, looking at the
mortality of all living creatures, and comparing them with one
another in their lives and habits, gave vent to his thoughts in the
words,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Of all the things that on the
earth do breathe,</span> <span class="i0">Or creep, man is by far
the wretchedest;"<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id=

</div>

<p>assigning to man an unhappy pre-eminence in extreme misfortune.
But let us, assuming that man is, as thus publicly declared,
supreme in infelicity and the most wretched of all living
creatures, compare him with himself, in the estimate of his misery
dividing body and soul, not idly but in a very necessary way, that
we may learn whether our life is more wretched owing to Fortune or
through our own fault. For disease is engendered in the body by
nature, but vice and depravity in the soul is first its own doing,
then its settled condition. And it is no slight aid to tranquillity
of mind if what is bad be capable of cure, and lighter and less
violent.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> The fox in &AElig;sop<a
name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> disputing with the
leopard as to their respective claims to variety, the latter showed
its body and appearance all bright and spotted, while the tawny
skin of the former was dirty and not pleasant to look at. Then the
fox said, "Look inside me, sir judge, and you will see that I am
more full of variety than my opponent," referring to his trickiness
and versatility in shifts. Let us similarly say to ourselves, Many
diseases and disorders, good sir, thy body naturally produces of
itself, many also it receives from without; but if thou lookest at
thyself within thou wilt find, to borrow the language of
Democritus, a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id=
"Page_143">143</a></span>varied and susceptible storehouse and
treasury of what is bad, not flowing in from without, but having as
it were innate and native springs, which vice, being exceedingly
rich and abundant in passion, produces. And if diseases are
detected in the body by the pulse and by pallors and flushes,<a
name="FNanchor_314_314" id="FNanchor_314_314"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_314_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> and are indicated by
heats and sudden pains, while the diseases of the mind, bad as they
are, escape the notice of most people, the latter are worse because
they deprive the sufferer of the perception of them. For reason if
it be sound perceives the diseases of the body, but he that is
diseased in his mind cannot judge of his sufferings, for he suffers
in the very seat of judgement. We ought to account therefore the
first and greatest of the diseases of the mind that ignorance,<a
name="FNanchor_315_315" id="FNanchor_315_315"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_315_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> whereby vice is
incurable for most people, dwelling with them and living and dying
with them. For the beginning of getting rid of disease is the
perception of it, which leads the sufferer to the necessary relief,
but he who through not believing he is ill knows not what he
requires refuses the remedy even when it is close at hand. For
amongst the diseases of the body those are the worst which are
accompanied by stupor, as lethargies, headaches, epilepsies,
apoplexies, and those fevers which raise inflammation to the pitch
of madness, and disturb the brain as in the case of a musical
instrument,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"And move the mind's strings
hitherto untouched."<a name="FNanchor_316_316" id=
"FNanchor_316_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_316" class=
"fnanchor">316</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> And so doctors wish a man
not to be ill, or if he is ill to be ignorant of it, as is the case
with all diseases of the soul. For neither those who are out of
their minds, nor the licentious, nor the unjust think themselves
faulty&mdash;some even think themselves perfect. For no one ever
yet called a fever health, or consumption a good condition of body,
or gout swift-footedness, or paleness a good colour; but many call
anger manliness, and love friendship, and envy competition, <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>and
cowardice prudence. Then again those that are ill in body send for
doctors, for they are conscious of what they need to counteract
their ailments; but those who are ill in mind avoid philosophers,
for they think themselves excellent in the very matters in which
they come short. And it is on this account that we maintain that
ophthalmia is a lesser evil than madness, and gout than frenzy. For
the person ill in body is aware of it and calls loudly for the
doctor, and when he comes allows him to anoint his eye, to open a
vein, or to plaster up his head; but you hear mad Agave in her
frenzy not knowing her dearest ones, but crying out, "We bring from
the mountain to the halls a young stag recently torn limb from
limb, a fortunate capture."<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id=
"FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class=
"fnanchor">317</a> Again he who is ill in body straightway gives up
and goes to bed and remains there quietly till he is well, and if
he toss and tumble about a little when the fit is on him, any of
the people who are by saying to him,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i15">"Gently,</span> <span class=

</div>

<p>restrain him and check him. But those who suffer from a diseased
brain are then most active and least at rest, for impulses bring
about action, and the passions are vehement impulses. And so they
do not let the mind rest, but when the man most requires quiet and
silence and retirement, then is he dragged into the open air, and
becomes the victim of anger, contentiousness, lust, and grief, and
is compelled to do and say many lawless things unsuitable to the
occasion.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> As therefore the storm
which prevents one's putting into harbour is more dangerous than
the storm which will not let one sail, so those storms of the soul
are more formidable which do not allow a man to take in sail, or to
calm his reason when it is disturbed, but without a pilot and
without ballast, in perplexity and uncertainty through contrary and
confusing courses, he rushes headlong and falls into woeful
shipwreck, and shatters his life. So that <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>from these points of
view it is worse to be diseased in mind than body, for the latter
only suffer, but the former do ill as well as suffer ill. But why
need I speak of our various passions? The very times bring them to
our mind. Do you see yon great and promiscuous crowd jostling
against one another and surging round the rostrum and forum? They
have not assembled here to sacrifice to their country's gods, nor
to share in one another's rites; they are not bringing to
Ascr&aelig;an Zeus the firstfruits of Lydian produce,<a name=
"FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> nor are they
celebrating in honour of Dionysus the Bacchic orgies on festival
nights with common revellings; but a mighty plague stirring up Asia
in annual cycles drives them here for litigation and suits at law
at stated times: and the mass of business, like the confluence of
mighty rivers, has inundated one forum, and festers and teems with
ruiners and ruined. What fevers, what agues, do not these things
cause? What obstructions, what irruptions of blood into the
air-vessels, what distemperature of heat, what overflow of humours,
do not result? If you examine every suit at law, as if it were a
person, as to where it originated, where it came from, you will
find that one was produced by obstinate temper, another by frantic
love of strife, a third by some sordid desire.<a name=

<h3><a name="Page_145a" id="Page_145a">ON ABUNDANCE OF
FRIENDS.</a></h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Menon the Thessalian, who
thought he was a perfect adept in discourse, and, to borrow the
language of Empedocles, "had attained the heights of wisdom," was
asked by Socrates, what virtue was, and upon his answering quickly
and glibly, that virtue was a different thing in boy and old man,
and in man and woman, and in magistrate and private person, and in
master and servant, "Capital," said Socrates, "you were asked about one virtue, but you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>have raised up a whole swarm of them,"<a
name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> conjecturing not amiss
that the man named many because he knew not one. Might not someone
jeer at us in the same way, as being afraid, when we have not yet
one firm friendship, that we shall without knowing it fall upon an
abundance of friends? It is very much the same as if a man maimed
and blind should be afraid of becoming hundred-handed like Briareus
or all eyes like Argus. And yet we wonderfully praise the young man
in Menander, who said that he thought anyone wonderfully good, if
he had even the shadow of a friend.<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id=
"FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class=
"fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p><a name="Page_146a" id="Page_146a" />&sect; <span class=
"smcap">ii.</span> But among many other things what stands chiefly
in the way of getting a friend is the desire for many friends, like
a licentious woman who, through giving her favours
indiscriminately, cannot retain her old lovers, who are neglected
and drop off;<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id=
"FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class=
"fnanchor">323</a> or rather like the foster-child of Hypsipyle,
"sitting in the meadow and plucking flower after flower, snatching
at each prize with gladsome heart, insatiable in its childish
delight,"<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a
href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> so in the case of
each of us, owing to our love of novelty and fickleness, the recent
flower ever attracts, and makes us inconstant, frequently laying
the foundations of many friendships and intimacies that come to
nothing, neglecting in love of what we eagerly pursue what we have
already possession of. To begin therefore with the domestic
hearth,<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a
href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> as the saying is,
with the traditions of life that time has handed down to us about
constant friends, let us take the witness and counsel of antiquity,
according to which friendships go in pairs, as in the cases of
Theseus and Pirithous, Achilles and Patroclus, Orestes and Pylades,
Phintias and Damon, Epaminondas and Pelopidas. For friendship is a
creature that goes in pairs, and is not gregarious, or crow-like,<a
name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> and to think a <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id=
"Page_147">147</a></span>friend a second self, and to call him
companion as it were second one,<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id=
"FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class=
"fnanchor">327</a> shows that friendship is a dual relation. For we
can get neither many slaves nor many friends at small expense. What
then is the purchase-money of friendship? Benevolence and
complaisance conjoined with virtue, and yet nature has nothing more
rare than these. And so to love or be loved very much cannot find
place with many persons; for as rivers that have many channels and
cuttings have a weak and thin stream, so excessive love in the soul
if divided out among many is weakened. Thus love for their young is
most strongly implanted in those that bear only one, as Homer calls
a beloved son "the only one, the child of old age,"<a name=
"FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> that is, when the
parents neither have nor are likely to have another child.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> Not that we insist on
only one friend, but among the rest there should be one eminently
so, like a child of old age, who according to that well-known
proverb has eaten a bushel of salt with one,<a name=
"FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> not as nowadays many
so-called friends contract friendship from drinking together once,
or playing at ball together, or playing together with dice, or
passing the night together at some inn, or meeting at the
wrestling-school or in the market. And in the houses of rich and
leading men people congratulate them on their many friends, when
they see the large and bustling crowd of visitors and handshakers
and retainers: and yet they see more flies in their kitchens, and
as the flies only come for the dainties, so they only dance
attendance for what they can get. And since true friendship has
three main requirements, virtue, as a thing good; and familiarity,
as a thing pleasant; and use, as a thing serviceable; for we ought
to choose a friend with judgement, and rejoice in his company, and
make use of him in need; and all these things are prejudicial to
abundance of friends, especially judgement, which is the most
important point; we must first consider, if it is impossible in a
short time to test dancers who are to form a chorus, or rowers who
are to pull together, or slaves who are to act as stewards of
estates, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id=
"Page_148">148</a></span>or as tutors of one's sons, far more
difficult is it to meet with many friends who will take off their
coats to aid you in every fortune, each of whom "offers his
services to you in prosperity, and does not object to share your
adversity." For neither does a ship encounter so many storms at
sea, nor do they fortify places with walls, or harbours with
defences and earthworks, in the expectation of so many and great
dangers, as friendship tested well and soundly promises defence and
refuge from. But if friends slip in without being tested, like
money proved to be bad,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Those who shall lose such
friends may well be glad,</span> <span class="i0">And those who
have such pray that they may lose them."<a name="FNanchor_330_330"

</div>

<p>Yet is it difficult and by no means easy to avoid and bring to a
close an unpleasant friendship: as in the case of food which is
injurious and harmful, we cannot retain it on the stomach without
damage and hurt, nor can we expel it as it was taken into the
mouth, but only in a putrid mixed up and changed form, so a bad
friend is troublesome both to others and himself if retained, and
if he be got rid of forcibly it is with hostility and hatred, and
like the voiding of bile.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> We ought not, therefore,
lightly to welcome or strike up an intimate friendship with any
chance comers, or love those who attach themselves to us, but
attach ourselves to those who are worthy of our friendship. For
what is easily got is not always desirable: and we pass over and
trample upon heather and brambles that stick to us<a name=
"FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> on our road to the
olive and vine: so also is it good not always to make a friend of
the person who is expert in twining himself around us, but after
testing them to attach ourselves to those who are worthy of our
affection and likely to be serviceable to us.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> As therefore Zeuxis, when
some people accused him of painting slowly, replied, "I admit that
I do, but then I paint to last," so ought we to test for a long
time the friendship and intimacy that we take up and mean to <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id=
"Page_149">149</a></span>keep. Is it not easy then to put to the
test many friends, and to associate with many friends at the same
time, or is this impossible? For intimacy is the full enjoyment of
friendship, and most pleasant is companying with and spending the
day with a friend. "Never again shall we alive, apart from dear
friends, sit and take counsel alone together."<a name=
"FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> And Menelaus said
about Odysseus, "Nor did anything ever divide or separate us, who
loved and delighted in one another, till death's black cloud
overshadowed us."<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id=
"FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class=
"fnanchor">333</a> The contrary effect seems to be produced by
abundance of friends. For the friendship of a pair of friends draws
them together and puts them together and holds them together, and
is heightened by intercourse and kindliness, "as when the juice of
the fig curdles and binds the white milk,"<a name=
"FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> as Empedocles says,
such unity and complete union will such a friendship produce.
Whereas having many friends puts people apart and severs and
disunites them, by transferring and shifting the tie of friendship
too frequently, and does not admit of a mixture and welding of
goodwill by the diffusing and compacting of intimacy. And this
causes at once an inequality and difficulty in respect of acts of
kindness, for the uses of friendship become inoperative by being
dispersed over too wide an area. "One man is acted upon by his
character, another by his reflection."<a name="FNanchor_335_335"
id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class=
"fnanchor">335</a> For neither do our natures and impulses always
incline in the same directions, nor are our fortunes in life
identical, for opportunities of action are, like the winds,
favourable to some, unfavourable to others.</p>

<p><a name="Page_149a" id="Page_149a"></a>&sect; <span class=
"smcap">vi.</span> Moreover, if all our friends want to do the same
things at the same time, it will be difficult to satisfy them all,
whether they desire to deliberate, or to act in state affairs, or
wish for office, or are going to entertain guests. If again at the
same time they chance to be engaged in different occupations and
interests and ask you all together, one who is going on a voyage
that you will sail with him, another who is going to law that you
will be his advocate, another who is going to try a case that you
will try it with him, another who is selling or buying that you
will go into <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id=
"Page_150">150</a></span>partnership with him, another who is going
to marry that you will join him in the sacrifice, another who is
going to bury a relation that you will be one of the mourners,</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>that is the fruit of many friends; to oblige all is impossible,
to oblige none is absurd, and to help one and offend many is
grievous.</p>

</div>

<p>And yet people bear patiently and without anger the carelessness
and neglect of friends, if they get from them such excuses as "I
forgot," "I did it unwittingly." But he who says, "I did not assist
you in your lawsuit, for I was assisting another friend," or "I did
not visit you when you had your fever, for I was helping so-and-so
who was entertaining his friends," excusing himself for his
inattention to one by his attention to another, so far from making
the offence less, even adds jealousy to his neglect. But most
people in friendship regard only, it seems, what can be got out of
it, overlooking what will be asked in return, and not remembering
that he, who has had many of his own requests granted, must oblige
others in turn by granting their requests. And as Briareus with his
hundred hands had to feed fifty stomachs, and was therefore no
better provided than we are, who with two hands have to supply the
necessities of only one belly, so in having many friends<a name=
"FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> one has to do many
services for them, one has to share in their anxiety, and to toil
and moil with them. For we must not listen to Euripides when he
says, "mortals ought to join in moderate friendships for one
another, and not love with all their heart, that the spell may be
soon broken, and the friendship may either be ended or become
closer at will,"<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id=
"FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class=
"fnanchor">339</a> that so it may be adjusted to our requirements,
like the sail of a ship that we can either slacken or haul <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id=
"Page_151">151</a></span>tight. But let us transfer, Euripides,
these lines of yours to enmities, and bid people make their
animosities moderate, and not hate with all their heart, that their
hatred, and wrath, and querulousness, and suspicions, may be easily
broken. Recommend rather for our consideration that saying of
Pythagoras, "Do not give many your right hand,"<a name=
"FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> that is, do not make
many friends, do not go in for a common and vulgar friendship,
which is sure to cause anyone much trouble; for its sharing in
others' anxieties and griefs and labours and dangers is quite
intolerable to free and noble natures. And that was a true saying
of the wise Chilo<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id=
"FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class=
"fnanchor">341</a> to one who told him he had no enemy, "Neither,"
said he, "do you seem to me to have a friend." For enmities
inevitably accompany and are involved in friendships.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> It is impossible I say
not to share with a friend in his injuries and disgraces and
enmities, for enemies at once suspect and hate the friend of their
enemies, and even friends are often envious and jealous and carp at
him. As then the oracle given to Timesias about his colony foretold
him, "that his swarm of bees would soon be followed by a swarm of
wasps," so those that seek a swarm of friends have sometimes
lighted unawares on a wasp's-nest of enemies. And the remembrance
of wrongs done by an enemy and the kindness of a friend do not
weigh in the same balance. See how Alexander treated the friends
and intimates of Philotas and Parmenio, how Dionysius treated those
of Dion, Nero those of Plautus, Tiberius those of Sejanus,
torturing and putting them to death. For as neither the gold nor
rich robes of Creon's daughter<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id=
"FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class=
"fnanchor">342</a> availed her or her sire, but the flame that
burst out suddenly involved him in the same fate as herself, as he
ran up to embrace her and rescue her, so some friends, though they
have had no enjoyment out of their friends' prosperity, are
involved in their misfortunes. And this is especially the case with
philosophers and kind people, as Theseus, when his friend Pirithous
was punished and im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id=
"Page_152">152</a></span>prisoned, "was also bound in fetters not
of brass."<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a
href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> And Thucydides
tells us that during the plague at Athens those that most displayed
their virtue perished with their friends that were ill, for they
neglected their own lives in going to visit them.<a name=
"FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> We ought not therefore
to be too lavish with our virtue, binding it together and
implicating it in various people's fortunes, but we ought to
preserve our friendship for those who are worthy of it, and are
capable of reciprocating it. For this is indeed the greatest
argument against many friends that friendship is originated by
similarity. For seeing that even the brutes can hardly be forced to
mix with those that are unlike themselves, but crouch down, and
show their dislike, and run away, while they mix freely with those
that are akin to them and have a similar nature, and gently and
gladly make friends with one another then, how is it possible that
there should be friendship between people differing in characters
and temperaments and ideas of life? For harmony on the harp or lyre
is attained by notes in unison and not in unison, sharp and flat
somehow or other producing concord, but in the harmony of
friendship there must be no unlike, or uneven, or unequal element,
but from all alike must come agreement in opinions and wishes and
feeling, as if one soul were put into several bodies.</p>

<p><a name="Page_152a" id="Page_152a" />&sect; <span class=
"smcap">ix.</span> What man then is so industrious, so changeable,
and so versatile, as to be able to make himself like and adapt
himself to many different persons, and not to laugh at the advice
of Theognis, "Imitate the ingenuity of the polypus, that takes the
colour of whatever stone it sticks to."<a name="FNanchor_345_345"
id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class=
"fnanchor">345</a> And yet the changes in the polypus do not go
deep but are only on the surface, which, from its thickness or
thinness takes the impression of everything that approaches it,
whereas friends endeavour to be like one another in character, and
feeling, and language, and pursuits, and disposition. It requires a
not very fortunate or very good Proteus,<a name="FNanchor_346_346"
id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class=
"fnanchor">346</a> able by jugglery to assume various forms, to be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id=
"Page_153">153</a></span>frequently at the same time a student with
the learned, and ready to try a fall with wrestlers, or to go a
hunting with people fond of the chase, or to get drunk with
tipplers, or to go a canvassing with politicians, having no fixed
character of his own.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id=
"FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class=
"fnanchor">347</a> And as the natural philosophers say of unformed
and colourless matter when subjected to external change, that it is
now fire, now water, now air, now solid earth, so the soul suitable
for many friendships must be impressionable, and versatile, and
pliant, and changeable. But friendship requires a steady constant
and unchangeable character, a person that is uniform in his
intimacy. And so a constant friend is a thing rare and hard to
find.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_153a" id="Page_153a" />HOW ONE MAY DISCERN A
FLATTERER FROM A FRIEND.</h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Plato says,<a name=
"FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> Antiochus Philopappus,
that all men pardon the man who acknowledges that he is excessively
fond of himself, but that there is among many other defects this
very grave one in self-love, that by it a man becomes incapable of
being a just and impartial judge about himself, for love is blind
in regard to the loved object, unless a person has learnt and
accustomed himself to honour and pursue what is noble rather than
his own selfish interests. This gives a great field for the
flatterer in friendship, who finds a wonderful base of operations
in our self-love, which makes each person his own first and
greatest flatterer, and easily admits a flatterer from without, who
will be, so he thinks and hopes, both a witness and confirmer of
his good opinion of himself. For he that lies open to the reproach
of being fond of flatterers is very fond of himself, and owing to
his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id=
"Page_154">154</a></span>goodwill to himself wishes to possess all
good qualities, and thinks he actually does; the wish is not
ridiculous, but the thought is misleading and requires a good deal
of caution. And if truth is a divine thing, and, according to
Plato,<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> the beginning of all
good things both to the gods and men, the flatterer is likely to be
an enemy to the gods, and especially to Apollo, for he always sets
himself against that famous saying, "Know thyself,"<a name=
"FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> implanting in
everybody's mind self-deceit and ignorance of his own good or bad
qualities, thus making his good points defective and imperfect, and
his bad points altogether incorrigible.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> If however, as is the case
with most other bad things, the flatterer attacked only or chiefly
ignoble or worthless persons, the evil would not be so mischievous
or so difficult to guard against. But since, as wood-worms breed
most in soft and sweet wood, those whose characters are honourable
and good and equitable encourage and support the flatterer
most,&mdash;and moreover, as Simonides says, "rearing of horses
does not go with the oil-flask,<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id=
"FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class=
"fnanchor">351</a> but with fruitful fields," so we see that
flattery does not join itself to the poor, the obscure, or those
without means, but is the snare and bane of great houses and
estates, and often overturns kingdoms and principalities,&mdash;it
is a matter of no small importance, needing much foresight, to
examine the question, that so flattery may be easily detected, and
neither injure nor discredit friendship. For just as lice leave
dying persons, and abandon bodies when the blood on which they feed
is drying up, so one never yet saw flatterers dancing attendance on
dry and cold poverty, but they fasten on wealth and position and
there get fat, but speedily decamp if reverses come. But we ought
not to wait to experience that, which would be unprofitable, or
rather injurious and dangerous. For not to find friends at a time
when you want them is hard, as also not to be able to exchange an
inconstant and bad friend for a constant and good one. For a friend
should be like money tried before being re<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>quired, not found
faulty in our need. For we ought not to have our wits about us only
when the mischief is done, but we ought to try and prevent the
flatterer doing any harm to us: for otherwise we shall be in the
same plight as people who test deadly poisons by first tasting
them, and kill or nearly kill themselves in the experiment. We do
not praise such, nor again all those who, looking at their friend
simply from the point of view of decorum and utility, think that
they can detect all agreeable and pleasant companions as flatterers
in the very act. For a friend ought not to be disagreeable or
unpleasant, nor ought friendship to be a thing high and mighty with
sourness and austerity, but even its decorous deportment ought to
be attractive and winning,<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id=
"FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class=

</div>

<p>and not only to a person in misfortune "is it sweet to look into
the eyes of a friendly person," as Euripides<a name=
"FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> says, but no less does
it bring pleasure and charm in good fortune, than when it relieves
the sorrows and difficulties of adversity. And as Evenus said "fire
was the best sauce,"<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id=
"FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class=
"fnanchor">355</a> so the deity, mixing up friendship with life,
has made everything bright and sweet and acceptable by its presence
and the enjoyment it brings. How else indeed could the flatterer
insinuate himself by the pleasure he gives, unless he knew that
friendship admitted the pleasurable element? It would be impossible
to say. But just as spurious and mock gold only imitates the
brightness and glitter of real gold, so the flatterer seems to
imitate the pleasantness and agreeableness of the real friend, and
to exhibit himself ever merry and bright, contradicting and
opposing nothing. We must not however on that account suspect all
who <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id=
"Page_156">156</a></span>praise as simple flatterers. For
friendship requires praise as much as censure on the proper
occasion. Indeed peevishness and querulousness are altogether alien
to friendship and social life: but when goodwill bestows praise
ungrudgingly and readily upon good actions, people endure also
easily and without pain admonition and plainspeaking, believing and
continuing to love the person who took such pleasure in praising,
as if now he only blamed out of necessity.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> It is difficult then,
someone may say, to distinguish between the flatterer and the
friend, if they differ neither in the pleasure they give nor in the
praise they bestow; for as to services and attentions you may often
see friendship outstripped by flattery. Certainly it is so, I
should reply, if we are trying to find the genuine flatterer who
handles his craft with cleverness and art, but not if, like most
people, we consider those persons flatterers who are called their
own oil-flask-carriers and table-men, men who begin to talk, as one
said, the moment their hands have been washed for dinner,<a name=
"FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> whose servility,
ribaldry, and want of all decency, is apparent at the first dish
and glass. It did not of course require very much discrimination to
detect Melanthius the parasite of Alexander of Pher&aelig; of
flattery, who, to those who asked how Alexander was murdered,
answered, "Through his side into my belly": or those who formed a
circle round a wealthy table, "whom neither fire, nor sword, nor
steel, would keep from running to a feast":<a name=
"FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> or those female
flatterers in Cyprus, who after they crossed over into Syria were
nicknamed "step-ladders,"<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id=
"FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class=
"fnanchor">358</a> because they lay down and let the kings' wives
use their bodies as steps to mount their carriages.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> What kind of flatterer
then must we be on our guard against? The one who neither seems to
be nor acknowledges himself to be one: whom you will not always
find in the vicinity of your kitchen, who is not to be <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>caught
watching the dial to see how near it is to dinner-time,<a name=
"FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">359</a> nor gets so drunk as
to throw himself down anyhow, but one who is generally sober, and a
busybody, and thinks he ought to have a hand in your affairs, and
wishes to share in your secrets, and as to friendship plays rather
a tragic than a satyric or comic part. For as Plato says, "it is
the height of injustice to appear to be just when you are not
really so,"<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a
href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> so we must deem
the most dangerous kind of flattery not the open but the secret,
not the playful but the serious. For it throws suspicion even upon
a genuine friendship, which we may often confound with it, if we
are not careful. When Gobryas pursued one of the Magi into a dark
room, and was on the ground wrestling with him, and Darius came up
and was doubtful how he could kill one without killing both,
Gobryas bade him thrust his sword boldly through both of them;<a
name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> but we, since we give
no assent to that saying, "Let friend perish so the enemy perish
with him,"<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a
href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> in our endeavour
to distinguish the flatterer from the friend, seeing that their
resemblances are so many, ought to take great care that we do not
reject the good with the bad, nor in sparing what is beneficial
fall in with what is injurious. For as wild grains mixed up with
wheat, if very similar in size and appearance, are not easily kept
apart, for if the sieve have small holes they don't pass through,
and if large holes they pass with the corn, so flattery is not
easily distinguished from friendship, being mixed up with it in
feeling and emotion, habit and custom.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> Because however friendship
is the most pleasant of all things, and nothing more glads the
heart of man, therefore the flatterer attracts by the pleasure he
gives, pleasure being in fact his field. And because favours and
good services accompany friendship, as the proverb says "a friend
is more necessary than fire or water,"<a name="FNanchor_363_363"
id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class=
"fnanchor">363</a> therefore <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>the flatterer volunteers all
sorts of services, and strives to show himself on all occasions
zealous and obliging and ready. And since friendship is mainly
produced by a similarity of tastes and habits, and to have the same
likes and dislikes first brings people together and unites them
through sympathy,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id=
"FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class=
"fnanchor">364</a> the flatterer observing this moulds himself like
material and demeans himself accordingly, seeking completely to
imitate and resemble those whom he desires to ingratiate himself
with, being supple in change, and plausible in his imitations, so
that one would say,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Achilles' son, O no, it is
himself."<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a
href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>But his cleverest trick is that, observing that freedom of
speech, is both spoken of and reckoned as the peculiar and natural
voice of friendship, while not speaking freely is considered
unfriendly and disingenuous, he has not failed to imitate this
trait of friendship also. But just as clever cooks infuse bitter
sauces and sharp seasoning to prevent sweet things from cloying, so
these flatterers do not use a genuine or serviceable freedom of
speech, but merely a winking and tickling innuendo. He is therefore
difficult to detect, like those creatures which naturally change
their colour and take that of the material or place near them.<a
name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> But since he deceives
and conceals his true character by his imitations, it is our duty
to unmask him and detect him by the differences between him and the
true friend, and to show that he is, as Plato says, "tricked out in
other people's colours and forms, from lack of any of his own."<a
name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">367</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> Let us examine the matter
then from the beginning. I said that friendship originated in most
cases from a similar disposition and nature, generally inclined to
the same habits and morals, and rejoicing in the same pursuits,
studies, and amusements, as the following lines testify: "To old
man the voice of old man is sweetest, to boy that of boy, to woman
is most acceptable that of woman, to the sick person that of sick
person, while he that is overtaken <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>by misfortune is a comforter
to one in trouble." The flatterer knowing then that it is innate in
us to delight in, and enjoy the company of, and to love, those who
are like ourselves, attempts first to approach and get near a
person in this direction, (as one tries to catch an animal in the
pastures,) by the same pursuits and amusements and studies and
modes of life quietly throwing out his bait, and disguising himself
in false colours, till his victim give him an opportunity to catch
him, and become tame and tractable at his touch. Then too he
censures the things and modes of life and persons that he knows his
victim dislikes, while he praises those he fancies immoderately,
overdoing it indeed<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id=
"FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class=
"fnanchor">368</a> with his show of surprise and excessive
admiration, making him more and more convinced that his likes and
dislikes are the fruits of judgement and not of caprice.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> How then is the flatterer
convicted, and by what differences is he detected, of being only a
counterfeit, and not really like his victim? We must first then
look at the even tenor and consistency of his principles, if he
always delights in the same things, and always praises the same
things, and directs and governs his life after one pattern, as
becomes the noble lover of consistent friendship and familiarity.
Such a person is a friend. But the flatterer having no fixed
character of his own,<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id=
"FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class=
"fnanchor">369</a> and not seeking to lead the life suitable for
him, but shaping and modelling himself after another's pattern, is
neither simple nor uniform, but complex and unstable, assuming
different appearances, like water poured from vessel to vessel,
ever in a state of flux and accommodating himself entirely to the
fashion of those who entertain him. The ape indeed, as it seems,
attempting to imitate man, is caught imitating his movements and
dancing like him, but the flatterer himself attracts and decoys
other men, imitating not all alike, for with one he sings and
dances, with another he wrestles and gets covered with the dust of
the pal&aelig;stra, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id=
"Page_160">160</a></span>while he follows a third fond of hunting
and the chase all but shouting out the words of Ph&aelig;dra,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"How I desire to halloo on the
dogs,</span> <span class="i0">Chasing the dappled deer,"<a name=
"FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">370</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>and yet he has really no interest in the chase, it is the hunter
himself he sets the toils and snares for. And if the object of his
pursuit is some young scholar and lover of learning, he is all for
books then, his beard flows down to his feet,<a name=
"FNanchor_371_371" id="FNanchor_371_371"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_371_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> he's quite a sight
with his threadbare cloak, has all the indifference of the Stoic,
and speaks of nothing but the rectangles and triangles of Plato.
But if any rich and careless fellow fond of drink come in his
way,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Then wise Odysseus stript him
of his rags,"<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id=
"FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class=
"fnanchor">372</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>his threadbare cloak is thrown aside, his beard is shorn off
like a fruitless crop, he goes in for wine-coolers and tankards,
and laughs loudly in the streets, and jeers at philosophers. As
they say happened at Syracuse, when Plato went there, and Dionysius
was seized with a furious passion for philosophy, and so great was
the concourse of geometricians that they raised up quite a cloud of
dust in the palace, but when Plato fell out of favour, and
Dionysius gave up philosophy, and went back again headlong to wine
and women and trifles and debauchery, then all the court was
metamorphosed, as if they all had drunk of Circe's cup, for
ignorance and oblivion and silliness reigned rampant. I am borne
out in what I say by the behaviour of great flatterers and
demagogues,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a
href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> the greatest of
whom Alcibiades, a jeerer and horse-rearer at Athens, and living a
gay and merry life, wore his hair closely shaven at
Laced&aelig;mon, and washed in cold water, and attired himself in a
threadbare cloak; while in Thrace he fought<a name=
"FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> and drank; and at
Tissaphernes' court lived delicately and luxuriously and in a
pretentious style; and thus curried favour and was <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>popular
with everybody by imitating their habits and ways. Such was not the
way however in which Epaminondas or Agesilaus acted, for though
they associated with very many men and states and different modes
of life, they maintained everywhere their usual demeanour, both in
dress and diet and language and behaviour. So Plato<a name=
"FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">375</a> at Syracuse was
exactly the same man as in the Academy, the same with Dionysius as
with Dion.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> As to the changes of the
flatterer, which resemble those of the polypus,<a name=
"FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">376</a> a man may most easily
detect them by himself pretending to change about frequently, and
by censuring the kind of life he used formerly to praise, and anon
approving of the words actions and modes of life that he used to be
displeased with. He will then see that the flatterer is never
consistent or himself, never loving hating rejoicing grieving at
his own initiative, but like a mirror, merely reflecting the image
of other people's emotions and manners and feelings. Such a one
will say, if you censure one of your friends to him, "You are slow
in finding the fellow out, he never pleased me from the first." But
if on the other hand you change your language and praise him, he
will swear by Zeus that he rejoices at it, and is himself under
obligations to the man, and believes in him. And if you talk of the
necessity of changing your mode of life, of retiring from public
life to a life of privacy and ease, he says, "We ought long ago to
have got rid of uproar<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id=
"FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class=
"fnanchor">377</a> and envy." But if you think of returning again
to public life, he chimes in, "Your sentiments do you honour:
retirement from business is pleasant, but inglorious and mean." One
ought to say at once to such a one, "'Stranger, quite different now
you look to what you did before.'<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id=
"FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class=
"fnanchor">378</a> I do not need a friend to change his opinions
with me and to assent to me in everything, my shadow will do that
better, but I need one that will speak the truth and help me with
his judgement." This is one way of detecting the flatterer.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id=
"Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> We must also observe
another difference in the resemblance between the friend and
flatterer. The true friend does not imitate you in everything, nor
is he too keen to praise, but praises only what is excellent, for
as Sophocles says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"He is not born to share in
hate but love,"<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id=
"FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class=
"fnanchor">379</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>yes, by Zeus, and he is born to share in doing what is right and
in loving what is noble, and not to share in wrong-doing or
misbehaviour, unless it be that, as a running of the eyes is
catching, so through companionship and intimacy he may against his
will contract by infection some vice or ill habit, as they say
Plato's intimates imitated his stoop, Aristotle's his lisp, and
king Alexander's his holding his head a little on one side, and
rapidity of utterance in conversation,<a name="FNanchor_380_380"
id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class=
"fnanchor">380</a> for people mostly pick up unawares such traits
of character. But the flatterer is exactly like the chameleon,<a
name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">381</a> which takes every
colour but white, and so he, though unable to imitate what is worth
his while, leaves nothing that is bad unimitated. And just as poor
painters unable to make a fine portrait from inefficiency in their
craft, bring out the likeness by painting all the wrinkles, moles
and scars, so the flatterer imitates his friend's intemperance,
superstition, hot temper, sourness to domestics, suspicion of his
friends and relations. For he is by nature inclined to what is
worst, and thinks that imitation of what is bad is as far as
possible removed from censure. For those are suspected who have
noble aims in life, and seem to be vexed and disgusted at their
friends' faults, for that injured and even ruined Dion with
Dionysius, Samius with Philip, and Cleomenes with Ptolemy. But he
that wishes to be and appear at the same time both agreeable and
trustworthy pretends <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id=
"Page_163">163</a></span>to rejoice more in what is bad, as being
through excessive love for his friend not even offended at his
vices, but as one with him in feeling and nature in all matters.
And so they claim to share in involuntary and chance ailments, and
pretend to have the same complaints, in flattery to those who
suffer from any, as that their eyesight and sense of hearing are
deficient, if their friends are somewhat blind or deaf, as the
flatterers of Dionysius, who was rather short-sighted, jostled one
another at a dinner party, and knocked the dishes off the table,
<i>as if from defect of vision</i>.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id=
"FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class=
"fnanchor">382</a> And some to make their cases more similar wind
themselves in closer, and dive even into family secrets for
parallels. For seeing that their friends are unfortunate in
marriage, or suspicious about the behaviour of their sons or
relations, they do not spare themselves, but make quite a Jeremiad
about their own sons, or wife, or kinsfolk, or relations,
proclaiming loudly their own family secrets. For similarity in
situation makes people more sympathetic, and their friends having
received as it were hostages by their confessions, entrust them in
return with their secrets, and having once made confidants of them,
dare not take back their confidence.<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id=
"FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class=
"fnanchor">383</a> I actually know of a man who turned his wife out
of doors because his friend had put away his; but as he secretly
visited her and sent messages to her, he was detected by his
friend's wife noticing his conduct. So little did he know the
nature of a flatterer that thought the following lines more
applicable to a crab than a flatterer, "His whole body is belly,
his eye is on everything, he is a creature creeping on his teeth,"
for such is a true picture of the parasite, "friends of the
frying-pan, hunting for a dinner," to borrow the language of
Eupolis.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> However let us put off all
this to its proper place in the discourse. But let us not fail to
notice the wiliness of the flatterer's imitation, in that, even if
he imitates any good points in the person he flatters, he always
takes care to give him the palm. Whereas among real friends there
is no rivalry or jealousy of one another, but they are satisfied
and contented alike whether they are equal or one of them <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>is
superior. But the flatterer, ever remembering that he is to play
second fiddle,<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id=
"FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class=
"fnanchor">384</a> makes his copy always fall a little short of the
original, for he admits that he is everywhere outstripped and left
behind, except in vice. For in that alone he claims pre-eminence,
for if his friend is peevish, he says he is atrabilious; if his
friend is superstitious, he says he is a fanatic; if his friend is
in love, he says he is madly in love; if his friend laughs, he will
say, "You laughed a little unseasonably, but I almost died of
laughter." But in regard to any good points his action is quite the
opposite. He says he can run quickly, but his friend flies; he says
he can ride pretty well, but his friend is a Centaur on horseback.
He says "I am not a bad poet, and don't write very bad lines,"</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"'But your sonorous verse is
like Jove's thunder.'"</span></div>
</div>

<p>Thus he shows at once that his friend's aims in life are good,
and that his friend has reached a height he cannot soar to. Such
then are the differences in the resemblances between the flatterer
and the friend.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xi.</span> But since, as has been
said before, to give pleasure is common to both, for the good man
delights in his friends as much as the bad man in his flatterers,
let us consider the difference between them here too. The
difference lies in the different aim of each in giving pleasure.
Look at it this way. There is no doubt a sweet smell in perfume. So
there is also in medicine. But the difference is that while in
perfume pleasure and nothing else is designed, in medicine either
purging, or warming, or adding flesh to the system, is the primary
object, and the sweet smell is only a secondary consideration.
Again painters mix gay colours and dyes: there are also some drugs
which are gay in appearance and not unpleasing in colour. What then
is the difference between these? Manifestly we distinguish by the
end each aims at. So too the social life of friends employs mirth
to add a charm to some good and useful end,<a name=
"FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> and sometimes makes
joking and a good table and wine, aye, and even chaff and banter,
the seasoning to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id=
"Page_165">165</a></span>noble and serious matters, as in the
line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Much they enjoyed talking to
one another,"<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id=
"FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class=
"fnanchor">386</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>and again,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i9">"Never did ought else</span>
<span class="i0">Disturb our love or joy in one another."<a name=
"FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>But the flatterer's whole aim and end is to cook up and season
his joke or word or action, so as to produce pleasure. And to speak
concisely, the flatterer's object is to please in everything he
does, whereas the true friend always does what is right, and so
often gives pleasure, often pain, not wishing the latter, but not
shunning it either, if he deems it best. For as the physician, if
it be expedient, infuses saffron or spikenard, aye, or uses some
soothing fomentation or feeds his patient up liberally, and
sometimes orders castor,</p>

what is noble, as Agamemnon,</p>

<p>But where on the other hand there is need of correction, then he
rebukes with biting words and with the freedom worthy of a

<p>Sometimes also he joins action to word, as Menedemus sobered the
profligate and disorderly son of his friend Asclepiades, by
shutting him out of his house, and not speaking to him. And
Arcesilaus forbade Bato his school, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>when he wrote a line in one
of his plays against Cleanthes, and only got reconciled with him
after he repented and made his peace with Cleanthes. For we ought
to give our friend pain if it will benefit him, but not to the
extent of breaking off our friendship; but just as we make use of
some biting medicine, that will save and preserve the life of the
patient. And so the friend, like a musician, in bringing about an
improvement to what is good and expedient, sometimes slackens the
chords, sometimes tightens them, and is often pleasant, but always
useful. But the flatterer, always harping on one note, and
accustomed to play his accompaniment only with a view to please and
to ingratiate himself, knows not how either to oppose in deed, or
give pain in word, but complies only with every wish, ever chiming
in with and echoing the sentiments of his patron. As then Xenophon
says Agesilaus took pleasure in being praised by those who would
also censure him,<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id=
"FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class=
"fnanchor">392</a> so ought we to think that to please and gratify
us is friendly in the person who can also give us pain and oppose
us, but to feel suspicion at an intercourse which is merely for
pleasure and gratification, and never pungent, aye and by Zeus to
have ready that saying of the Laced&aelig;monian, who, on hearing
king Charillus praised, said, "How can he be a good man, who is not
severe even to the bad?"</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xii.</span> They say the gadfly
attacks bulls, and the tick dogs, in the ear: so the flatterer
besieges with praise the ears of those who are fond of praise, and
sticks there and is hard to dislodge. We ought therefore here to
make a wide-awake and careful discrimination, whether the praise is
bestowed on the action or the man. It is bestowed on the action, if
people praise the absent rather than the present, if also those
that have the same aims and aspirations praise not only us but all
that are similarly disposed, and do not evidently say and do one
thing at one time, and the direct contrary at another; and the
greatest test is if we are conscious, in the matters for which we
get the praise, that we have not regretted them, and are not
ashamed at them, and would not rather have said and done
differently. For <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id=
"Page_167">167</a></span>our own inward judgement, testifying the
contrary and not admitting the praise, is above passion, and
impregnable and proof against the flatterer. But I know not how it
is that most people in misfortune cannot bear exhortation, but are
captivated more by condolence and sympathy, and when they have done
something wrong and acted amiss, he that by censure and blame
implants in them the stings of repentance is looked upon by them as
hostile and an accuser, while they welcome and regard as friendly
and well-disposed to them the person who bestows praise and
panegyric on what they have done. Those then that readily praise
and join in applauding some word or action on the part of someone
whether in jest or earnest, only do temporary harm for the moment,
but those who injure the character by their praise, aye, and by
their flattery undermine the morals, act like those slaves who do
not steal from the bin, but from the seed corn.<a name=
"FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> For they pervert the
disposition, which is the seed of actions, and the character, which
is the principle and fountain of life, by attaching to vice names
that belong properly only to virtue. For as Thucydides says,<a
name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> in times of faction
and war "people change the accustomed meaning of words as applied
to acts at their will and pleasure, for reckless daring is then
considered bravery to one's comrades, and prudent delay specious
cowardice, and sober-mindedness the cloak of the coward, and taking
everything into account before action a real desire to do nothing."
So too in the case of flattery we must observe and be on our guard
against wastefulness being called liberality, and cowardliness
prudence, and madness quick-wittedness, and meanness frugality, and
the amorous man called social and affectionate, and the term manly
applied to the passionate and vain man, and the term civil applied
to the paltry and mean man. As I remember Plato<a name=
"FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> says the lover is a
flatterer <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id=
"Page_168">168</a></span>of the beloved one, and calls the snub
nose graceful, and the aquiline nose royal, and swarthy people
manly, and fair people the children of the gods, and the olive
complexion is merely the lover's phrase to gloss over and palliate
excessive pallor. And yet the ugly man persuaded he is handsome, or
the short man persuaded he is tall, cannot long remain in the
error, and receives only slight injury from it, and not irreparable
mischief: but praise applied to vices as if they were virtues, so
that one is not vexed but delighted with a vicious life, removes
all shame from wrong-doing, and was the ruin of the Sicilians, by
calling the savage cruelty of Dionysius and Phalaris detestation of
wickedness and uprightness. It was the ruin of Egypt, by styling
Ptolemy's effeminacy, and superstition, and howlings, and beating
of drums, religion and service to the gods.<a name=
"FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">396</a> It was nearly the
overthrow and destruction of the ancient manners of the Romans,
palliating the luxury and intemperance and display of Antony as
exhibitions of jollity and kindliness, when his power and fortune
were at their zenith. What else invested Ptolemy<a name=

"#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> with his pipe and

"FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class=
"fnanchor">398</a> on the tragic stage, and invested him with the
mask and buskins? Was it not the praise of flatterers? And are not
many kings called Apollos if they can just sing a song,<a name=
"FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> and Dionysuses if they
get drunk, and Herculeses if they can wrestle, and do they not joy
in such titles, and are they not dragged into every kind of
disgrace by flattery?</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> Wherefore we must be
especially on our guard against the flatterer in regard to praise;
as indeed he is very well aware himself, and clever to avoid
suspicion. If he light upon some dandy, or rustic in a thick
leather garment, he treats him with nothing but jeers and mocks,<a
name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> as Struthias insulted
Bias, ironically praising him for his stupidity, saying, "You have
drunk more than king Alex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169"

his tale about the Cyprian."<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id=
"FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class=
"fnanchor">402</a> But when he sees people more refined very much
on their guard, and observing both time and place, he does not
praise them directly, but draws off a little and wheels round and
approaches them noiselessly, as one tries to catch a wild animal.
For sometimes he reports to a man the panegyric of other persons
upon him, (as orators do, introducing some third person,) saying
that he had a very pleasant conversation in the market with some
strangers and men of worth, who mentioned how they admired his many
good points. On another occasion he concocts and fabricates some
false and trifling charges against him, pretending he has heard
them from other people, and runs up with a serious face and
inquires, where he said or did such and such a thing. And upon his
denying he ever did, he pounces on him at once<a name=
"FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> and compliments his
man with, "I thought it strange that you should have spoken ill of
your friends, seeing that you don't even treat your enemies so: and
that you should have tried to rob other people, seeing that you are
so lavish with your own money."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> Other flatterers again,
just as painters heighten the effect of their pictures by the
combination of light and shade, so by censure abuse detraction and
ridicule of the opposite virtues secretly praise and foment the
actual vices of those they flatter. Thus they censure modesty as
merely rustic behaviour in the company of profligates, and greedy
people, and villains, and such as have got rich by evil and
dishonourable courses; and contentment and uprightness they call
having no spirit or energy in action; and when they associate with
lazy and idle persons who avoid all public duties, they are not
ashamed to call the life of a citizen wearisome meddling in other
people's affairs, and the desire to hold office fruitless
vain-glory. And some ere now to flatter an orator have depreciated
a philosopher, and others won favour with wanton women by traducing
those wives who are faithful to their husbands as constitutionally
cold and countrybred. And by an acme of villainy flatterers <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>do
not always spare even themselves. For as wrestlers stoop that they
may the easier give their adversaries a fall, so by censuring
themselves they glide into praising others. "I am a cowardly
slave," says such a one, "at sea, I shirk labour, I am madly in
rage if a word is said against me; but this man fears nothing, has
no vices, is a rare good fellow, patient and easy in all
circumstances." But if a person has an excellent idea of his own
good sense, and desires to be austere and self-opinionated, and in
his moral rectitude is ever spouting that line of Homer,</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>the artistic flatterer does not attack him as he attacked
others, but employs against such a one a new device. For he comes
to him about his own private affairs, as if desirous to have the
advice of one wiser than himself; he has, he says, more intimate
friends, but he is obliged to trouble him; "for whither shall we
that are deficient in judgement go? whom shall we trust?" And
having listened to his utterance he departs, saying he has received
an oracle not an opinion. And if he notices that somebody lays
claim to experience in oratory, he gives him some of his writings,
and begs him to read and correct them. So, when king Mithridates
took a fancy to play the surgeon, several of his friends offered
themselves for operating upon, as for cutting or cauterizing,
flattering in deed and not in word, for his being credited by them
would seem to prove his skill.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id=

<p>But we can test this kind of negative praise, that needs more
wary caution, by purposely giving strange advice and suggestions,
and by adopting absurd corrections. For if he raises no objection
but nods assent to everything, and approves of everything, and is
always crying out, "Good! How admirable!" he is evidently</p>

Moreover, as some have defined painting to be silent poetry,<a
name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> so is there praise in
silent flattery. For as hunters are more likely to catch the
objects of their chase unawares, if they do not openly appear to be
so engaged, but seem to be walking, or tending their sheep, or
looking after the farm, so flatterers obtain most success in their
praise, when they do not seem to be praising but to be doing
something else. For he who gives up his place or seat to the great
man when he comes in, and while making a speech to the people or
senate breaks off even in the middle, if he observes any rich man
wants to speak, and gives up to him alike speech and platform,
shows by his silence even more than he would by any amount of
vociferation that he thinks the other the better man, and superior
to him in judgement. And consequently you may always see them
occupying the best places at theatres and public assembly rooms,
not that they think themselves worthy of them, but that they may
flatter the rich by giving up their places to them; and at public
meetings they begin speaking first, and then make way as for better
men, and most readily take back their own view, if any influential
or rich or famous person espouse the contrary view. And so one can
see plainly that all such servility and drawing back on their part
is a lowering their sails, not to experience or virtue or age, but
to wealth and fame. Not so Apelles the famous painter, who, when
Megabyzus sat with him, and wished to talk about lines and shades,
said to him, "Do you see my lads yonder grinding colours, they
admired just now your purple and gold, but now they are laughing at
you for beginning to talk about what you don't understand."<a name=
"FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">408</a> And Solon, when
Cr&oelig;sus asked him about happiness, replied that Tellus, an

"#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> But flatterers
proclaim kings and rich men and rulers not only happy and
fortunate, but also pre-eminent for wisdom, and art, and every
virtue.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id=

some cannot bear to hear the assertion of the Stoics<a name=
"FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> that the wise man is
at once rich, and handsome, and noble, and a king; but flatterers
declare that the rich man is at once orator and poet, and (if he
likes) painter, and flute-player, and swift-footed, and strong,
falling down if he wrestles with them, and if contending with him
in running letting him win the race, as Crisso of Himera purposely
allowed Alexander to outrun him, which vexed the king very much
when he heard of it.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id=
"FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class=
"fnanchor">411</a> And Carneades said that the sons of rich men and
kings learnt nothing really well and properly except how to ride,
for their master praised and flattered them in their studies, and
the person who taught them wrestling always let them throw him,
whereas the horse, not knowing or caring whether his rider were a
private person or ruler, rich or poor, soon threw him over his head
if he could not ride well. Simple therefore and fatuous was that
remark of Bion, "If you could by encomiums make your field to yield
well and be fruitful, you could not be thought wrong in tilling it
so rather than digging it and labouring in it: nor would it be
strange in you to praise human beings if by so doing you could be
useful and serviceable to them." For a field does not become worse
by being praised, but those who praise a man falsely and against
his deserts puff him up and ruin him.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvii.</span> Enough has been said on
this matter: let us now examine outspokenness. For just as
Patroclus put on the armour of Achilles, and drove his horses to
the battle, only durst not touch his spear from Mount Pelion, but
let that alone, so ought the flatterer, tricked out and modelled in
the distinctive marks and tokens of the friend, to leave untouched
and uncopied only his outspokenness, as the special burden of
friendship, "heavy, huge, strong."<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id=
"FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class=
"fnanchor">412</a> But since flatterers, to avoid the blame they
incur by their buffoonery, and drinking, and gibes, and jokes,
sometimes work their ends by frowns and gravity, and intermix
cen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id=
"Page_173">173</a></span>sure and reproof, let us not pass this
over either without examination. And I think, as in Menander's Play
the sham Hercules comes on the stage not with a club stout and
strong, but with a light and hollow cane, so the outspokenness of
the flatterer is to those who experience it mild and soft, and the
very reverse of vigorous, and like those cushions for women's
heads, which seem able to stand their ground, but in reality yield
and give way under their pressure; so this sham outspokenness is
puffed up and inflated with an empty and spurious and hollow
bombast, that when it contracts and collapses draws in the person
who relies on it. For true and friendly outspokenness attacks
wrong-doers, bringing pain that is salutary and likely to make them
more careful, like honey biting but cleansing ulcerated parts of
the body,<a name="FNanchor_413_413" id="FNanchor_413_413"></a><a
href="#Footnote_413_413" class="fnanchor">413</a> but in other
respects serviceable and sweet. But we will speak of this anon.<a
name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> But the flatterer
first exhibits himself as disagreeable and passionate and
unforgiving in his dealings with others. For he is harsh to his
servants, and a terrible fellow to attack and ferret out the faults
of his kinsmen and friends, and to look up to and respect nobody
who is a stranger, but to look down upon them, and is relentless
and mischief-making in making people provoked with others, hunting
after the reputation of hating vice, as one not likely knowingly to
mince matters with the vicious, or ingratiate himself with them
either in word or deed. Next he pretends to know nothing of real
and great crimes, but he is a terrible fellow to inveigh against
trifling and external shortcomings, and to fasten on them with
intensity and vehemence, as if he sees any pot or pipkin out of its
place, or anyone badly housed, or neglecting his beard or attire,
or not adequately attending to a horse or dog. But contempt of
parents, and neglect of children, and bad treatment of wife, and
haughtiness to friends, and throwing away money, all this he cares
nothing about, but is silent and does not dare to make any allusion
to it: just as if the trainer in a gymnasium were to allow the
athlete to get drunk and live in debauchery,<a name=
"FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>and yet be
vexed at the condition of his oil-flask or strigil if out of order;
or as if the schoolmaster scolded a boy about his tablet and pen,
but paid no attention to a solecism or barbarism. The flatterer is
like a man who should make no comment on the speech of a silly and
ridiculous orator, but should find fault with his voice, and chide
him for injuring his throat by drinking cold water; or like a
person bidden to read some wretched composition, who should merely
find fault with the thickness of the paper, and call the copyist a
dirty and careless fellow. So too when Ptolemy seemed to desire to
become learned, his flatterers used to spin out the time till
midnight, disputing about some word or line or history, but not one
of them all objected to his cruelty and outrages, his torturing and
beating people to death.<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id=
"FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class=
"fnanchor">416</a> Just as if, when a man has tumours and fistulas,
one were to cut his hair and nails with a surgeon's knife, so
flatterers use outspokenness only in cases where it gives no pain
or distress.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xviii.</span> Moreover some of them
are cleverer still and make their outspokenness and censure a means
of imparting pleasure. As Agis the Argive,<a name=
"FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">417</a> when Alexander
bestowed great gifts on a buffoon, cried out in envy and
displeasure, "What a piece of absurdity!" and on the king turning
angrily to him and saying, "What are you talking about?" he
replied, "I admit that I am vexed and put out, when I see that all
you descendants of Zeus alike take delight in flatterers and
jesters, for Hercules had his Cercopes, and Dionysus his Sileni,
and with you too I see that such are held in good repute." And on
one occasion, when the Emperor Tiberius entered the senate, one of
his flatterers got up and said, that being free men they ought to
be outspoken, and not suppress or conceal anything that might be
important, and having by this exordium engaged everybody's
attention, a dead silence prevailing, and even Tiberius being all
attention, he said, "Listen, C&aelig;sar, to what we all charge you
with, although no one ventures to tell you openly of it; you
neglect yourself, and are careless <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>about your health, and wear
yourself out with anxiety and labour on our behalf, taking no rest
either by night or day." And on his stringing much more together in
the same strain, they say the orator Cassius Severus said, "This
outspokenness will ruin the man."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xix.</span> These are indeed trifling
matters: but the following are more important and do mischief to
foolish people, when flatterers accuse them of the very contrary
vices and passions to those to which they are really addicted; as
Himerius the flatterer twitted a very rich, very mean, and very
covetous Athenian with being a careless spendthrift, and likely one
day to want bread as well as his children; or on the other hand if
they rail at extravagant spendthrifts for meanness and sordidness,
as Titus Petronius railed at Nero; or exhort rulers who make savage
and cruel attacks on their subjects to lay aside their excessive
clemency, and unseasonable and inexpedient mercy. Similar to these
is the person who pretends to be on his guard against and afraid of
a silly stupid fellow as if he were clever and cunning; and the one
who, if any person fond of detraction, rejoicing in defamation and
censure, should be induced on any occasion to praise some man of
note, fastens on him and alleges against him that he has an itch
for praising people. "You are always extolling people of no merit:
for who is this fellow, or what has he said or done out of the
common?" But it is in regard to the objects of their love that they
mostly attack those they flatter, and additionally inflame them.
For if they see people at variance with their brothers, or
despising their parents, or treating their wives contemptuously,
they neither take them to task nor scold them, but fan the flame of
their anger still more. "You don't sufficiently appreciate
yourself," they say, "you are yourself the cause of your being put
upon in this way, through your constant submissiveness and
humility." And if there is any tiff or fit of jealousy in regard to
some courtesan or adulteress, the flatterer is at hand with
remarkable outspokenness, adding fuel to flame,<a name=

"FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class=
"fnanchor">420</a> persuaded him that he was loved by her, and
twitted him with being cold and haughty to her. "She," they said,
"has left her mighty kingdom and happy mode of life, and is wasting
her beauty, taking the field with you like some camp-follower,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"The while your heart is proof

<p>as you neglect her love-lorn as she is." But he that is pleased
at being reproached with his wrong-doing, and delights in those
that censure him, as he never did in those that praised him, is
unconscious that he is really perverted also by what seems to be
rebuke. For such outspokenness is like the bites of wanton women,<a
name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> that while seeming to
hurt really tickle and excite pleasure. And just as if people mix
pure wine, which is by itself an antidote against hemlock, with it
and so offer it, they make the poison quite deadly, being rapidly
carried to the heart by the warmth,<a name="FNanchor_423_423" id=
"FNanchor_423_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_423" class=
"fnanchor">423</a> so ill-disposed men, knowing that outspokenness
is a great antidote to flattery, make it a means of flattering. And
so it was rather a bad answer Bias<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id=
"FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class=
"fnanchor">424</a> made, to the person who inquired what was the
most formidable animal, "Of wild animals the tyrant, and of tame
the flatterer." For it would have been truer to observe that tame
flatterers are those that are found round the baths and table, but
the one that intrudes into the interior of the house and into the
women's apartments with his curiosity and calumny and malignity,
like the legs and arms of the polypus, is wild and savage and
unmanageable.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xx.</span> Now one kind of caution
against his snares is to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177"
id="Page_177">177</a></span>know and ever remember that, whereas
the soul contains true and noble and reasoning elements, as also
unreasoning and false and emotional ones, the friend is always a
counsellor and adviser to the better instincts of the soul, as the
physician improves and maintains health, whereas the flatterer
works upon the emotional and unreasoning ones, and tickles and
titillates them and seduces them from reason, employing sensuality
as his bait. As then there are some kinds of food which neither
benefit the blood or spirit, nor brace up the nerves and marrow,
but stir the passions, excite the lower nature, and make the flesh
unsound and rotten, so the language of the flatterer adds nothing
to soberness and reason, but encourages some love passion, or stirs
up foolish rage, or incites to envy, or produces the empty and
burdensome vanity of pride, or joins in bewailing woes, or ever by
his calumnies and hints makes malignity and illiberality and
suspicion sharp and timid and jealous, and cannot fail to be
detected by those that closely observe him. For he is ever
anchoring himself upon some passion, and fattening it, and, like a
bubo, fastens himself on some unsound and inflamed parts of the
soul. Are you angry? Have your revenge, says he. Do you desire
anything? Get it. Are you afraid? Let us flee. Do you suspect?
Entertain no doubts about it. But if he is difficult to detect in
thus playing upon our passions, since they often overthrow reason
by their intensity and strength, he will give a handle to find him
out in smaller matters, being consistent in them too. For if anyone
feels a little uneasy after a surfeit or excess in drink, and so is
a little particular about his food and doubts the advisability of
taking a bath, a friend will try and check him from excess, and bid
him be careful and not indulge, whereas the flatterer will drag him
to the bath, bid him serve up some fresh food, and not starve
himself and so injure his constitution. And if he see him reluctant
about a journey or voyage or some business or other, he will say
that there is no hurry, that it's all one whether the business be
put off, or somebody else despatched to look after it. And if you
have promised to lend or give some money to a friend, but have
repented of your offer, and yet feel ashamed not to keep your
promise, the flatterer will throw<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span> his influence into the
worse scale, he will confirm your desire to save your purse, he
will destroy your reluctance, and will bid you be careful as having
many expenses, and others to think about besides that person. And
so, unless we are entirely ignorant of our desires, our
shamelessness, and our timidity, the flatterer cannot easily escape
our detection. For he is ever the advocate of those passions, and
outspoken when we desire to repress them.<a name="FNanchor_425_425"
id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class=
"fnanchor">425</a> But so much for this matter.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxi.</span> Now let us pass on to
useful and kind services, for in them too the flatterer makes it
very difficult and confusing to detect him from the friend, seeming
to be zealous and ready on all occasions and never crying off. For,
as Euripides says,<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id=
"FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class=
"fnanchor">426</a> a friend's behaviour is, "like the utterance of
truth, simple," and plain and inartificial, while that of the
flatterer "is in itself unsound, and needs wise remedies," aye, by
Zeus, and many such, and not ordinary ones. As for example in
chance meetings the friend often neither speaks nor is spoken to,
but merely looks and smiles, and then passes on, showing his inner
affection and goodwill only by his countenance, which his friend
also reciprocates, but the flatterer runs up, follows, holds out
his hand at a distance, and if he is seen and addressed first,
frequently protests with oaths, and calls witnesses to prove, that
he did not see you. So in business friends neglect many unimportant
points, are not too punctilious and officious, and do not thrust
themselves upon every service, but the flatterer is persevering and
unceasing and indefatigable in it, giving nobody else either room
or place to help, but putting himself wholly at your disposal, and
if you will not find him something to do for you, he is troubled,
nay rather altogether dejected and lamenting loudly.<a name=
"FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxii.</span> To all sensible people
all this is an indication, not of true or sober friendship, but of
a meretricious one, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id=
"Page_179">179</a></span>that embraces you more warmly than there
is any occasion for. Nevertheless let us first look at the
difference between the friend and flatterer in their promises. For
it has been well said by those who have handled this subject before
us, that the friend's promise is,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"If I can do it, and 'tis to
be done,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>but the flatterer's is,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Speak out your mind, whate'er
it is, to me."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id=
"FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class=
"fnanchor">428</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>And the comic dramatists put such fellows on the stage,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Nicomachus, pit me against
that soldier,</span> <span class="i0">See if I beat him not into a
jelly,</span> <span class="i0">And make his face e'en softer than a
sponge."<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a
href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>In the next place no friend participates in any matter, unless
he has first been asked his advice, and put the matter to the test,
and set it on a suitable and expedient basis. But the flatterer, if
anyone allows him to examine a matter and give his opinion on it,
not only wishes to gratify him by compliance, but also fearing to
be looked upon with suspicion as unwilling and reluctant to engage
in the business, gives in to and even urges on his friend's desire.
For there is hardly any king or rich man who would say,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"O that a beggar I could find,
or worse</span> <span class="i0">Than beggar, if, with good intent
to me,</span> <span class="i0">He would lay bare his heart boldly
and honestly;"<a name="FNanchor_430_430" id=
"FNanchor_430_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_430" class=
"fnanchor">430</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>but, like the tragedians, they require a chorus of sympathizing
friends, or the applause of a theatre. And so Merope gives the
following advice in the tragedy,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Choose you for friends those
who will speak their mind,</span> <span class="i0">For those bad
men that only speak to please</span> <span class="i0">See that you
bolt and bar out of your house."<a name="FNanchor_431_431" id=
"FNanchor_431_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_431" class=
"fnanchor">431</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>But they act just the contrary, for they turn away with horror
from those who speak their mind, and hold different <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>views as
to what is expedient, while they welcome those bad and illiberal
impostors (that only speak to please them) not only within their
houses, but also to their affections and secrets. Now the simpler
of these do not think right or claim to advise you in important
matters, but only to assist in the carrying out of them: but the
more cunning one stands by during the discussion, and knits his
brows, and nods assent with his head, but says nothing, but if his
friend express an opinion, he then says, "Hercules, you only just
anticipated me, I was about to make that very remark." For as the
mathematicians tell us that surfaces and lines neither bend nor
extend nor move of themselves, being without body and only
perceived by the mind, but only bend and extend and change their
position with the bodies whose extremities they are: so you will
catch the flatterer ever assenting with, and agreeing with, aye,
and feeling with, and being angry with, another, so easy of
detection in all these points of view is the difference between the
friend and the flatterer. Moreover as regards the kind of good
service. For the favour done by a friend, as the principal strength
of an animal is within, is not for display or ostentation, but
frequently as a doctor cures his patient imperceptibly, so a friend
benefits by his intervention, or by paying off creditors, or by
managing his friend's affairs, even though the person who receives
the benefit may not be aware of it. Such was the behaviour of
Arcesilaus on various occasions, and when Apelles<a name=
"FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">432</a> of Chios was ill,
knowing his poverty, he took with him twenty drachm&aelig; when he
visited him, and sitting down beside him he said, "There is nothing
here but those elements of Empedocles, 'fire and water and earth
and balmy expanse of air,' but you don't lie very comfortably," and
with that he moved his pillow, and privately put the money under
it. And when his old housekeeper found it, and wonderingly told
Apelles of it, he laughed and said, "This is some trick of
Arcesilaus." And the saying is also true in philosophy that
"children are like their parents."<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id=
"FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class=
"fnanchor">433</a> For <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id=
"Page_181">181</a></span>when Cephisocrates had to stand his trial
on a bill of indictment, Lacydes (who was an intimate friend of
Arcesilaus) stood by him with several other friends, and when the
prosecutor asked for his ring, which was the principal evidence
against him, Cephisocrates quietly dropped it on the ground, and
Lacydes noticing this put his foot on it and so hid it. And after
sentence was pronounced in his favour, Cephisocrates going up to
thank the jury, one of them who had seen the artifice told him to
thank Lacydes, and related to him all the matter, though Lacydes
had not said a word about it to anybody. So also I think the gods
do often perform benefits secretly, taking a natural delight in
bestowing their favours and bounties.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id=
"FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class=
"fnanchor">434</a> But the good service of the flatterer has no
justice, or genuineness, or simplicity, or liberality about it; but
is accompanied with sweat, and running about, and noise, and
knitting of the brow, creating an impression and appearance of
toilsome and bustling service, like a painting over-curiously
wrought in bold colours, and with bent folds wrinkles and angles,
to make the closer resemblance to life. Moreover he tires one by
relating what journeys and anxieties he has had over the matter,
how many enemies he has made over it, the thousand bothers and
annoyances he has gone through, so that you say, "The affair was
not worth all this trouble." For being reminded of any favour done
to one is always unpleasant and disagreeable and insufferable:<a
name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> but the flatterer not
only reminds us of his services afterwards, but even during the
very moment of doing them upbraids us with them and is importunate.
But the friend, if he is obliged to mention the matter, relates it
modestly, and says not a word about himself. And so, when the
Laced&aelig;monians sent corn to the people of Smyrna that needed
it, and the people of Smyrna wondered at their kindness, the
Laced&aelig;monians said, "It was no great matter, we only voted
that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id=
"Page_182">182</a></span>we and our beasts of burden should go
without our dinner one day, and sent what was so saved to you."<a
name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> Not only is it
handsome to do a favour in that way, but it is more pleasant to the
receivers of it, because they think those who have done them the
service have done it at no great loss to themselves.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxiii.</span> But it is not so much
by the importunity of the flatterer in regard to services, nor by
his facility in making promises, that one can recognize his nature,
as by the honourable or dishonourable kind of service, and by the
regard to please or to be of real use. For the friend is not as
Gorgias defined him, one who will ask his friend to help him in
what is right, while he will himself do many services for his
friend that are not right.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"For friend should share in
good not in bad action."<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id=

</div>

<p>He will therefore rather try and turn him away from what is not
becoming, and if he cannot persuade him, good is that answer of
Phocion to Antipater, "You cannot have me both as friend and
flatterer,"<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a
href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">438</a> that is, as
friend and no friend. For one must indeed assist one's friend but
not do anything wrong for him, one must advise with him but not
plot with him, one must bear witness for him but not join him in
fraud, one must certainly share adversity with him but not crime.
For since we should not wish even to know of our friends'
dishonourable acts, much less should we desire to share their
dishonour by acting with them. As then the Laced&aelig;monians,
when conquered in battle by Antipater, on settling the terms of
peace, begged that he would lay upon them what burdens he pleased,
provided he enjoined nothing dishonourable, so the friend, if any
necessity arise involving expense or danger or trouble, is the
first to desire to be applied to and share in it with alacrity and
without crying off, but if there be anything disgraceful in
connection with it he begs to have nothing to do with it. The
flatterer on the contrary cries off from <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>toilsome and dangerous
employments, and if you put him to the test by ringing him,<a name=
"FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> he returns a hollow
and spurious sound, and finds some excuse; whereas use him in
disgraceful and low and disreputable service, and trample upon him,
he will think no treatment too bad or ignominious. Have you
observed the ape? He cannot guard the house like the dog, nor bear
burdens like the horse, nor plough like the ox, so he has to bear
insult and ribaldry, and put up with being made sport of,
exhibiting himself as an instrument to produce laughter. So too the
flatterer, who can neither advocate your cause, nor give you useful
counsel, nor share in your contention with anybody, but shirks all
labour and toil, never makes any excuses in underhand transactions,
is sure to lend a helping hand in any love affair, is energetic in
setting free some harlot, and not careless in clearing off the
account of a drinking score, nor remiss in making preparations for
banquets, and obsequious to concubines, but if ordered to be
uncivil to your relations, or to help in turning your wife out of
doors, he is relentless and not to be put out of countenance. So
that he is not hard to detect here too. For if ordered to do
anything you please disreputable or dishonourable, he is ready to
take any pains to oblige you.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxiv.</span> One might detect again
how greatly the flatterer differs from the friend by his behaviour
to other friends. For the friend is best pleased with loving and
being beloved by many, and also always tries to contrive for his
friend that he too may be much loved and honoured, for he believes
in the proverb "the goods of friends are common property,"<a name=
"FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> and thinks it ought to
apply to nothing more than to friends; but the false and spurious
and counterfeit friend, knowing how much he debases friendship,
like debased and spurious coin, is not only by nature envious, but
shows his envy even of those who are like himself, striving to
outdo them in scurrility and gossip, while he quakes and trembles
at any of his betters, not by Zeus "merely walking on foot by their
Lydian chariot," but, to use the language of Simonides, "not even,
having pure lead by <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id=
"Page_184">184</a></span> comparison with their refined gold."<a
name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> Whenever then, being
light and counterfeit and false, he is put to the test at close
quarters with a true and solid and cast-iron friendship, he cannot
stand the test but is detected at once, and imitates the conduct of
the painter that painted some wretched cocks, for he ordered his
lad to scare away all live cocks as far from his picture as
possible. So he too scares away real friends and will not let them
come near if he can help it, but if he cannot prevent that, he
openly fawns upon them, and courts them, and admires them as his
betters, but privately runs them down and spreads calumnies about
them. And when secret detraction has produced a sore feeling,<a
name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> if he has not effected
his end completely, he remembers and observes the teaching of
Medius, who was the chief of Alexander's flatterers, and a leading
sophist in conspiracy against the best men. He bade people
confidently sow their calumny broadcast and bite with it, teaching
them that even if the person injured should heal his sore, the scar
of the calumny would remain. Consumed by these scars, or rather
gangrenes and cancers, Alexander put to death Callisthenes, and
Parmenio, and Philotas; while he himself submitted to be completely
outwitted by such as Agnon, and Bagoas, and Agesias, and Demetrius,
who worshipped him and tricked him up and feigned him to be a
barbaric god. So great is the power of flattery, and nowhere
greater, as it seems, than among the greatest people. For their
thinking and wishing the best about themselves makes them credit
the flatterer, and gives him courage.<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id=
"FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class=
"fnanchor">443</a> For lofty heights are difficult of approach and
hard to reach for those who <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>endeavour to scale them, but
the highmindedness and conceit of a person thrown off his balance
by good fortune or good natural parts is easily reached by mean and
petty people.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxv.</span> And so we advised at the
beginning of this discourse, and now advise again, to cut off
self-love and too high an opinion of ourselves; for that flatters
us first, and makes us more impressionable and prepared for
external flatterers. But if we hearken to the god, and recognize
the immense importance to everyone of that saying, "Know
thyself,"<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a
href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">444</a> and at the same
time carefully observe our nature and education and training, with
its thousand shortcomings in respect to good, and the large
proportion of vice and vanity mixed up with our words and deeds and
feelings, we shall not make ourselves so easy a mark for
flatterers. Alexander said that he disbelieved those who called him
a god chiefly in regard to sleep and the sexual delight, for in
both those things he was more ignoble and emotional than in other
respects.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a
href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> So we, if we
observe the blots, blemishes, shortcomings, and imperfections of
our private selves, shall perceive clearly that we do not need a
friend who shall bestow upon us praise and panegyric, but one that
will reprove us, and speak plainly to us, aye, by Zeus, and censure
us if we have done amiss. For it is only a few out of many that
venture to speak plainly to their friends rather than gratify them,
and even among those few you will not easily find any who know how
to do so properly, for they think they are outspoken when they
abuse and scold. And yet, just as in the case of any other
medicine, to employ freedom of speech unseasonably is only to give
needless pain and trouble, and in a manner to do so as to produce
vexation the very thing the flatterer does so as to produce
pleasure. For it does people harm not only to praise them
unseasonably but also to blame them unseasonably, and especially
exposes them to the successful attack of flatterers, for, like
water, they abandon the rugged hills for the soft grassy valleys.
And so outspokenness ought to be tempered with kindness, and reason
ought to be called in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id=
"Page_186">186</a></span>to correct its excessive tartness, (as we
tone down the too powerful glare of a lamp), that people may not,
by being troubled and grieved at continual blame and rebuke, fly
for refuge to the shade of the flatterer, and turn aside to him to
free themselves from annoyance. For we ought, Philopappus, to
banish all vice by virtue, not by the opposite vice, as some
hold,<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> by exchanging modesty
for impudence, and countrified ways for town ribaldry, and by
removing their character as far as possible from cowardice and
effeminacy, even if that should make people get very near to
audacity and foolhardiness. And some even make superstition a plea
for atheism, and stupidity a plea for knavery, perverting their
nature, like a stick bent double, from inability to set it
straight. But the basest disowning of flattery is to be
disagreeable without any purpose in view, and it shows an
altogether inelegant and clumsy unfitness for social intercourse to
shun by unpleasing moroseness the suspicion of being mean and
servile in friendship; like the freedman in the comedy who thought
railing only enjoying freedom of speech. Seeing then, that it is
equally disgraceful to become a flatterer through trying only to
please, as in avoiding flattery to destroy all friendship and
intimacy by excessive freedom of speech, we must avoid both these
extremes, and, as in any other case, make our freedom of speech
agreeable by its moderation. So the subject itself seems next to
demand that I should conclude it by discussing that point.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxvi.</span> As then we see that much
trouble arises from excessive freedom of speech, let us first of
all detach from it any element of self-love, being carefully on our
guard that we may not appear to upbraid on account of any private
hurt or injury. For people do not regard a speech on the speaker's
own behalf as arising from goodwill, but from anger, and reproach
rather than admonition. For freedom in speech is friendly and has
weight, but reproach is selfish and little. And so people respect
and admire those that speak their mind freely, but accuse back and
despise those that reproach them: as Agamemnon would not stand the
moderate freedom of speech of Achilles, but <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>submitted
to and endured the bitter attack and speech of Odysseus,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Pernicious chief, would that

</div>

<p>for he was restrained by the carefulness and sobriety of his
speech, and also Odysseus had no private motive of anger but only

"FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class=

account. And Achilles himself, though not sweet-tempered or mild of
mood, but "a terrible man, and one that would perchance blame an
innocent person,"<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id=
"FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class=

<p>For as Hyperides the orator bade the Athenians consider not only
whether he spoke bitterly, but whether he spoke so from interested
motives,<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a
href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> so the rebuke of
a friend void of all private feeling is solemn and grave and what
one dare not lightly face. And if anyone shows plainly in his
freedom of speech, that he altogether passes over and dismisses any
offences his friend has done to himself, and only blames him for
other shortcomings, and does not spare him but gives him pain for
the interests of others, the tone of his outspokenness is
invincible, and the sweetness of his manner even intensifies the
bitterness and austerity of his rebuke. And so it has well been
said, that in anger and differences with our friends we ought more
especially to act with a view to their interest or honour. And no
less friendly is it, when it appears that we have been passed over
and neglected, to boldly put in a word for others that are
neglected too, and to remind people of them, as Plato, when he was
out of favour with Dionysius, begged for an <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>audience,
and Dionysius granted it, thinking that Plato had some personal
grievance and was going to enter into it, but Plato opened the
conversation as follows, "If, Dionysius, you knew that some enemy
had sailed to Sicily with a view to do you some harm, but found no
opportunity, would you allow him to sail back again, and go off
scot-free?" "Certainly not, Plato," replied Dionysius, "for we must
not only hate and punish the deeds of our enemies, but also their
intentions." "If then," said Plato, "anyone has come here for your
benefit, and wishes to do you good, and you do not find him an
opportunity, is it right to let him go away with neglect and
without thanks?" And on Dionysius asking, who he meant, he replied,
"I mean &AElig;schines, a man of as good a character as any of
Socrates' pupils whatever, and able to improve by his conversation
any with whom he might associate: and he is neglected, though he
has made a long voyage here to discuss philosophy with you." This
speech so affected Dionysius, that he at once threw his arms round
Plato and embraced him, admiring his benevolence and loftiness of
mind, and treated &AElig;schines well and handsomely.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxvii.</span> In the next place, let
us clear away as it were and remove all insolence, and jeering, and
mocking, and ribaldry, which are the evil seasonings of freedom of
speech. For as, when the surgeon performs an operation, a certain
neatness and delicacy of touch ought to accompany his use of the
knife, but all pantomimic and venturesome and fashionable
suppleness and over-finicalness ought to be far away from his hand,
so freedom of speech admits of dexterity and politeness, provided
that a pleasant way of putting it does not destroy the power of the
rebuke, for impudence and coarseness and insolence, if added to
freedom of speech, entirely mar and ruin the effect. And so the
harper plausibly and elegantly silenced Philip, who ventured to
dispute with him about proper playing on the harp, by answering
him, "God forbid that you should be so unfortunate, O king, as to
understand harping better than me." But that was not a right answer
of Epicharmus, when Hiero a few days after putting to death some of
his friends invited him to supper, "You did not invite me," he<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
said, "the other day, when you sacrificed your friends." Bad also
was that answer of Antiphon, who, when Dionysius asked him "which
was the best kind of bronze," answered, "That of which the
Athenians made statues of Harmodius and Aristogiton." For this
unpleasant and bitter kind of language profits not those that use
it, nor does scurrility and puerile jesting please, but such kind
of speeches are indications of an incontinent tongue inspired by
hate, and full of malignity and insolence, and those who use such
language do but ruin themselves, recklessly dancing on the verge of
a well.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a
href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> For Antiphon was
put to death by Dionysius, and Timagenes lost the friendship of
Augustus, not by using on any occasion too free a tongue, but at
supper-parties and walks always declining to talk seriously, "only
saying what he knew would make the Argives laugh,"<a name=
"FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> and thus virtually
charging friendship with being only a cloak for abuse. For even the
comic poets have introduced on the stage many grave sentiments well
adapted to public life, but joking and ribaldry being mixed with
them, like insipid sauces with food, destroy their effect and make
them lose their nourishing power, so that the comic poets only get
a reputation for malignity and coarseness, and the audience get no
benefit from what is said. We may on other occasions jest and laugh
with our friends, but let our outspokenness be coupled with
seriousness and gravity, and if it be on important matters, let our
speech be trustworthy and moving from its pathos, and animation,
and tone of voice. And on all occasions to let an opportunity slip
by is very injurious, but especially does it destroy the usefulness
of freedom of speech. It is plain therefore that we must abstain
from freedom of speech when men are in their cups. For he disturbs
the harmony of a social gathering<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id=
"FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class=
"fnanchor">454</a> who, in the midst of mirth and jollity,
introduces a topic that shall knit the brows and contract the face,
and shall act as a damper to the Lysian<a name="FNanchor_455_455"
id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class=
"fnanchor">455</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id=
"Page_190">190</a></span>god, who, as Pindar says, "looses the rope
of all our cares and anxieties." There is also great danger in such
ill-timed freedom of speech. For wine makes people easily slip into
rage, and oftentimes freedom of speech in liquor makes enemies. And
generally speaking it is not noble or brave but cowardly to conceal
your ideas when people are sober and to give free vent to them at
table, snarling like cowardly dogs. We need say no more therefore
on this head.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxviii.</span> But since many people
do not think fit or even dare to find fault with their friends when
in prosperity, but think that condition altogether out of the reach
and range of rebuke, but inveigh against them if they have made a
slip or stumble, and trample upon them if they are in dejection and
in their power, and, like a stream swollen above its banks, pour
upon them then the torrent of all their eloquence,<a name=
"FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> and enjoy and are glad
at their reverse of fortune, owing to their former contempt of them
when they were poor themselves, it is not amiss to discuss this
somewhat, and to answer those words of Euripides,</p>

<div class="blockquot">"What need of friends, when things go well
with us?"<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a
href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">457</a></div>

<p>for those in prosperity stand in especial need of friends who
shall be outspoken to them, and abate their excessive pride. For
there are few who are sensible in prosperity, most need to borrow
wisdom from others, and such considerations as shall keep them
lowly when puffed up and giving themselves airs owing to their good
fortune. But when the deity has abased them and stripped them of
their conceit, there is something in their very circumstances to
reprove them and bring about a change of mind. And so there is no
need then of a friendly outspokenness, nor of weighty or caustic
words, but truly in such reverses "it is sweet to look into the
eyes of a friendly person,"<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id=
"FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class=
"fnanchor">458</a> consoling <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>and cheering one up: as
Xenophon<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a
href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">459</a> tells us that the
sight of Clearchus in battle and dangers, and his calm benevolent
face, inspired courage in his men when in peril. But he who uses to
a man in adversity too great freedom and severity of speech, like a
man applying too pungent a remedy to an inflamed and angry eye,
neither cures him nor abates his pain, but adds anger to his grief,
and exasperates his mental distress. For example anyone well is not
at all angry or fierce with a friend, who blames him for his
excesses with women and wine, his laziness and taking no exercise,
his frequent baths, and his unseasonable surfeiting: but to a
person ill all this is unsufferable, and even worse than his
illness to hear, "All this has happened to you through your
intemperance, and luxury, your dainty food, and love for women."
The patient answers, "How unseasonable is all this, good sir! I am
making my will, the doctors are preparing me a dose of castor and
scammony, and you are scolding me and plying me with philosophy."
And thus the affairs of the unfortunate do not admit of
outspokenness and a string of Polonius-like saws, but they require
kindness and help. For when children fall down their nurses do not
run up to them and scold, but pick them up, and clean them, and
tidy their dress, and afterwards find fault and correct them. The
story is told of Demetrius of Phalerum, when an exile from his
native country, and living a humble and obscure life at Thebes,
that he was not pleased to see Crates approaching, for he expected
to receive from him cynical outspokenness and harsh language. But
as Crates talked kindly to him, and discussed his exile, and
pointed out that there was no evil in it, or anything that ought to
put him about, for he had only got rid of the uncertainties and
dangers of public life, and at the same time bade him trust in
himself and his condition of mind, Demetrius cheered up and became
happier, and said to his friends, "Out upon all my former business
and employments, that left me no leisure to know such a man as
this!"</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxix.</span> In what cases then ought
a friend to be vehement, and when ought he to use emphatic freedom
of language? When circumstances call upon him to check some
headlong pleasure or rage or insolence, or to curtail avarice, or
to correct some foolish negligence. Thus Solon spoke out to
Cr&oelig;sus, who was corrupted and enervated by insecure good
fortune, bidding him look to the end.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id=
"FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class=
"fnanchor">463</a> Thus Socrates restrained Alcibiades, and wrung

name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> Such also was the
plain dealing of Cyrus with Cyaxares, and of Plato with Dion, for
when Dion was most famous and attracted to himself the notice of
all men, by the splendour and greatness of his exploits, Plato
warned him to fear and be on his guard against "pleasing only
himself, for so he would lose all his friends."<a name=
"FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> Speusippus also wrote
to him not to plume himself on being a great person only with lads
and women, but to see to it that by adorning Sicily with piety and
justice and good laws he might make the Academy glorious. On the
other hand Euctus and Eul&aelig;us, companions of Perseus, in the
days of his prosperity ingratiated themselves with him, and
assented to him in all things, and danced attendance upon him, like
all the other courtiers, but when he fled after his defeat by the
Romans at Pydna, they attacked him and censured him bitterly,
reminding him and upbraiding him in regard to everything he had
done amiss or neglected to do, till he was so greatly <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id=
"Page_193">193</a></span>exasperated both from grief and rage that
he whipped out his sword and killed both of them.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxx.</span> Let so much suffice for
general occasions of freedom of speech. There are also particular
occasions, which our friends themselves furnish, that one who
really cares for his friends will not neglect, but make use of. In
some cases a question, or narrative, or the censure or praise of
similar things in other people, gives as it were the cue for
freedom of speech. Thus it is related that Demaratus came to
Macedonia from Corinth at the time when Philip was at variance with
his wife and son, and when the king asked if the Greeks were at
harmony with one another, Demaratus, being his well-wisher and
friend, answered, "It is certainly very rich of you, Philip,
inquiring as to concord between the Athenians and Peloponnesians,
when you don't observe that your own house is full of strife and
variance."<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a
href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> Good also was the
answer of Diogenes, who, when Philip was marching to fight against
the Greeks, stole into his camp, and was arrested and brought
before him, and the king not recognizing him asked if he was a spy,
"Certainly," replied he, "Philip, I have come to spy out your
inconsiderate folly, which makes you, under no compulsion, come
here and hazard your kingdom and life on a moment's<a name=
"FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> cast of the die." This
was perhaps rather too strong a remark.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxxi.</span> Another suitable time
for reproof is when people have been abused by others for their
faults, and have consequently become humble, and abated their
pride. The man of tact will ingeniously seize the occasion,
checking and baffling those that used the abuse, but privately
speaking seriously to his friend, and reminding him, that he ought
to be more careful if for no other reason than to take off the edge
of his enemies' satire. He will say, "How can they open their
mouths against you, or what can they urge, if you give up and
abandon what you get this bad name about?" Thus pain comes only
from abuse, but profit from reproof. And some correct their friends
more <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id=
"Page_194">194</a></span>daintily by blaming others; censuring
others for what they know are their friends' faults. Thus my master
Ammonius in afternoon school, noticing that some of his pupils had
not dined sufficiently simply, bade one of his freedmen scourge his
own son, charging him with being unable to get through his dinner
without vinegar,<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id=
"FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class=
"fnanchor">468</a> but in acting thus he had an eye to us, so that
this indirect rebuke touched the guilty persons.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxxii.</span> We must also beware of
speaking too freely to a friend in the company of many people,
remembering the well-known remark of Plato. For when Socrates
reproved one of his friends too vehemently in a discussion at
table, Plato said, "Would it not have been better to have said this
privately?" Whereupon Socrates replied, "And you too, sir, would it
not have become you to make this remark also privately?" And
Pythagoras having rebuked one of his pupils somewhat harshly before
many people, they say the young fellow went off and hung himself,
and from that moment Pythagoras never again rebuked anyone in
another's presence. For, as in the case of some foul disease, so
also in the case of wrong-doing we ought to make the detection and
exposure private, and not ostentatiously public by bringing
witnesses and spectators. For it is not the part of a friend but a
sophist to seek glory by the ill-fame of another, and to show off
in company, like the doctors that perform wonderful cures in the
theatres as an advertisement.<a name="FNanchor_469_469" id=
"FNanchor_469_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_469" class=
"fnanchor">469</a> And independently of the insult, which ought not
to be an element in any cure, we must remember that vice is
contentious and obstinate. For it is not merely "love," as
Euripides says, that "if checked becomes more vehement," but an
unsparing rebuke before many people makes every infirmity and vice
more impudent. As then Plato<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id=
"FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class=
"fnanchor">470</a> urges old men who want to teach the young
reverence to act reverently to them first themselves, so among
friends a gentle rebuke is gently taken, and <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>a cautious
and careful approach and mild censure of the wrong-doer undermines
and destroys vice, and makes its own modesty catching. So that line
is most excellent, "holding his head near, that the others might
not hear."<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a
href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> And most
especially indecorous is it to expose a husband in the hearing of
his wife, or a father before his children, or a lover in the
presence of the loved one, or a master before his scholars. For
people are beside themselves with pain and rage if reproached
before those with whom they desire to be held in good repute. And I
think it was not so much wine that exasperated Alexander with
Clitus, as his seeming to put him down in the presence of many
people. And Aristomenes, the tutor of Ptolemy,<a name=
"FNanchor_472_472" id="FNanchor_472_472"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_472_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> because he went up to
the king and woke him as he was asleep in an audience of some
ambassadors, gave a handle to the king's flatterers who professed
to be indignant on his behalf, and said, "If after your immense
state-labours and many vigils you have been overpowered by sleep,
he ought to have rebuked you privately, and not put his hands upon
you before so many people." And Ptolemy sent for a cup of poison
and ordered the poor man to drink it up. And Aristophanes said
Cleon blamed him for "railing against the state when strangers were
present,"<a name="FNanchor_473_473" id="FNanchor_473_473"></a><a
href="#Footnote_473_473" class="fnanchor">473</a> and so irritating
the Athenians. We ought therefore to be very much on our guard in
relation to this point too as well as others, if we wish not to
make a display and catch the public ear, but to use our freedom of
speech for beneficial purposes and to cure vice. Moreover, what
Thucydides has represented the Corinthians saying of themselves,
that "they had a right to blame their neighbours,"<a name=
"FNanchor_474_474" id="FNanchor_474_474"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_474_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> is not a bad precept
for those to remember who intend to use freedom of speech.
Lysander, it seems, on one occasion said to a Megarian, who was
speaking somewhat boldly on behalf of Greece among the allies,
"Your words require a state to back <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>them":<a name=
"FNanchor_475_475" id="FNanchor_475_475"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_475_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> similarly every man's
freedom of speech requires character behind it, and especially true
is this in regard to those who censure and correct others. Thus
Plato said that his life was a tacit rebuke to Speusippus: and
doubtless Xenocrates by his mere presence in the schools, and by
his earnest look at Polemo, made a changed man of him. Whereas a
man of levity and bad character, if he ventures to rebuke anybody,
is likely to hear the line,</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxxiii.</span> Yet since
circumstances frequently call on people who are bad themselves in
association with other such to reprove them, the most convenient
mode of reproof will be that which contrives to include the
reprover in the same indictment as the reproved, as in the case of

<p>In this mild way did Socrates rebuke young men, as not himself
without ignorance, but one that needed in common with them to
prosecute virtue, and seek truth. For they gain goodwill and
influence, who seem to have the same faults as their friends, and
desire to correct themselves as well as them. But he who is high
and mighty in setting down another, as if he were himself perfect
and without any imperfections, unless he be of a very advanced age,
or has an acknowledged reputation for virtue and worth, does no
good, but is only regarded as a tiresome bore. And so it was wisely
done of Ph&oelig;nix to relate his own mishaps, how he had meant
killing his father, but quickly repented at the thought "that he
would be called by the Ach&aelig;ans parricide,"<a name=
"FNanchor_479_479" id="FNanchor_479_479"></a><a href=

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id=

be sympathetic and not supercilious. And since we ought not to
expose an inflamed eye to a strong light, and a soul a prey to the
passions cannot bear unmixed reproof and rebuke, one of the most
useful remedies will be found to be a slight mixture of praise, as
in the following lines,</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>For not only does it soften the harsh imperiousness of censure,
but also, by reminding a man of former noble deeds, implants a
desire to emulate his former self in the person who is ashamed of
what is low, and makes himself his own exemplar for better things.
But if we make a comparison between him and other men, as his
contemporaries, his fellow-citizens, or his relations, then the
contentious spirit inherent in vice is vexed and exasperated, and
is often apt to chime in angrily, "Why don't you go off to my
betters then, and leave off bothering me?" We must therefore be on
our guard against praising others, when we are rebuking a man,
unless indeed it be their parents, as Agamemnon says in Homer,</p>

But it is by no means fitting when rebuked to rebuke back, and when
spoken to plainly to answer back, for that soon kindles a flame and
causes dissension; and generally speaking such altercation will not
look so much like a retort as an inability to bear freedom of
speech. It is better therefore to listen patiently to a friend's
rebuke, for if he should afterwards do wrong himself and so need
rebuke, he has set you the example of freedom of speech. For being
reminded without any malice, that he himself has not been
accustomed to spare his friends when they have done wrong, but to
convince them and show them their fault, he will be the more
inclined to yield and give himself up to correction, as it will
seem a return of goodwill and kindness rather than scolding or
rage.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxxv.</span> Moreover, as Thucydides
says "he is well advised who [only] incurs envy in the most
important matters,"<a name="FNanchor_486_486" id=
"FNanchor_486_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_486" class=
"fnanchor">486</a> so the friend ought only to take upon himself
the unpleasant duty of reproof in grave and momentous cases. For if
he is always in a fret and a fume, and rates his acquaintances more
like a tutor than a friend, his rebuke will be blunt and
ineffective in cases of the highest importance, and he will
resemble a doctor who dispenses some sharp and bitter, but
important and costly, drug in trifling cases of common occurrence,
where it was not at all needed, and so will lose all the advantages
that might come from a judicious use of freedom of speech. He will
therefore be very much on his guard against continual
fault-finding, and if his friend is always pettifogging about
minute matters, and is needlessly querulous, it will give him a
handle against him in more important shortcomings. Philotimus the
doctor, when a patient who had abscesses on his liver showed him
his sore finger, said to him, "My friend, it is not the whitlow
that matters."<a name="FNanchor_487_487" id=
"FNanchor_487_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_487" class=
"fnanchor">487</a> So an opportunity sometimes offers itself to a
friend to say to a man, who is always finding fault on small and
trivial points, "Why are we always discussing mere child's play,
tippling,<a name="FNanchor_488_488" id="FNanchor_488_488"></a><a
href="#Footnote_488_488" class="fnanchor">488</a> <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>and
trifles? Let such a one, my dear sir, send away his mistress, or
give up playing at dice, he will then be in my opinion in all
respects an excellent fellow." For he who receives pardon on small
matters is content that his friend should rebuke him on matters of
more moment: but the man who is ever on the scold, everywhere sour
and glum, knowing and prying into everything, is scarcely tolerable
to his children or brothers, and insufferable to his slaves.</p>

<p><a name="Page_199a" id="Page_199a" />&sect; <span class="smcap">xxxvi.</span> But since "neither," to
use the words of Euripides, "do all troubles proceed only from old
age,"<a name="FNanchor_489_489" id="FNanchor_489_489"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_489_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> nor from the stupidity
of our friends, we ought to observe not only the shortcomings but
also the good points of our friends, aye, by Zeus, and to be ready
to praise them first, and only censure them afterwards. For as iron
receives its consistency and temper by first being submitted to
fire and so made soft and then dipped into cold water, so when
friends have been first warmed and melted with praises we can
afterwards use gentle remonstrance, which has a similar effect to
that of dipping in the case of the metal. For an opportunity will
offer itself to say, "Are those actions worthy to be compared with
these? Do you see what fruits virtue yields? These are the things
we your friends ask of you, these become you, for these you are
designed by nature; but all that other kind of conduct we must
reject with abhorrence, 'cast it away on a mountain, or throw it
into the roaring sea.'"<a name="FNanchor_490_490" id=
"FNanchor_490_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_490" class=
"fnanchor">490</a> For as a clever doctor would prefer to cure the
illness of his patient by sleep and diet rather than by castor or
scammony, so a kind friend and good father or teacher delight to
use praise rather than blame to correct the character. For nothing
makes rebuke less painful or more beneficial than to refrain from
anger, and to inveigh against wrong-doing mildly and kindly. And so
we ought not sharply to drive home the guilt of those who deny it,
or prevent their making their defence, but even contrive to furnish
them with specious excuses, and if they seem reluctant to give a
bad motive for their action we ought ourselves to find for them a
better, as Hector did for his brother Paris,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Unhappy man, thy anger was
not good,"<a name="FNanchor_491_491" id="FNanchor_491_491"></a><a

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id=
"Page_200">200</a></span>suggesting that his absconding from the
battle was not running away or cowardice, but only anger. And
Nestor says to Agamemnon,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"You only yielded to your
lofty passion."<a name="FNanchor_492_492" id=
"FNanchor_492_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_492" class=

</div>

<p>For it has, I think, a better moral tendency to say "You
forgot," or "You did it inadvertently," than to say "You acted
unfairly," or "You behaved shamefully:" as also "Don't contend with
your brother," than "Don't envy your brother;" and "Avoid the woman
who is your ruin," than "Stop ruining the woman." Such is the
language employed in rebuke that desires to reform and not to
wound; that rebuke which looks merely at the effect to be produced
acts on another principle. For when it is necessary to stop people
on the verge of wrong-doing, or to check some violent and irregular
impulse, or if we wish to rouse and infuse vigour in those who
prosecute virtue only feebly and languidly, we may then assign
strange and unbecoming motives for their behaviour. As Odysseus in
Sophocles' play,<a name="FNanchor_493_493" id=
"FNanchor_493_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_493" class=
"fnanchor">493</a> striving to rouse Achilles, says he is not angry
about his supper,<a name="FNanchor_494_494" id=
"FNanchor_494_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_494" class=
"fnanchor">494</a> but "that he is afraid now that he looks upon
the walls of Troy," and when Achilles was vexed at this, and talked
of sailing home again, he said,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I know what 'tis you shun:
'tis not ill fame:</span> <span class="i0">But Hector's near, it is
not safe to beard him."</span></div>
</div>

<p>Thus by frightening the high-spirited and courageous man by the
imputation of cowardice, and the sober and orderly man by that of
licentiousness, and the liberal and munificent man by that of
meanness and avarice, people urge them on to what is good, and
deter them from what is bad, showing moderation in cases past
remedy, and exhibiting in their freedom of speech more sorrow and
sympathy than fault-finding; but in the prevention of wrong-doing
and in earnest fighting against the passions they are vehement and
inexorable and assiduous: for that is the time <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>for
downright plainness and truth. Besides we see that enemies censure
one another for what they have done amiss, as Diogenes said,<a
name="FNanchor_495_495" id="FNanchor_495_495"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_495_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> he who wished to lead
a good life ought to have good friends or red-hot enemies, for the
former told you what was right, and the latter blamed you if you
did what was wrong. But it is better to be on our guard against
wrong actions, through listening to the persuasion of those that
advise us well, than to repent, after we have done wrong, in
consequence of the reproaches of our enemies. And so we ought to
employ tact in our freedom of speech, as it is the greatest and
most powerful remedy in friendship, and always needs a well-chosen
occasion, and moderation in applying it.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxxvii.</span> Since then, as I have
said before, freedom of speech is often painful to the person who
is to receive benefit from it, we must imitate the surgeons, who,
when they have performed an operation, do not leave the suffering
part to pain and smart, but bathe and foment it; so those who do
their rebuking daintily run<a name="FNanchor_496_496" id=
"FNanchor_496_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_496" class=
"fnanchor">496</a> off after paining and smarting, and by different
dealing and kind words soothe and mollify them, as statuaries
smooth and polish images which have been broken or chipped. But he
that is broken and wounded by rebuke, if he is left sullen and
swelling with rage and off his equilibrium, is henceforth hard to
win back or talk over. And so people who reprove ought to be
especially careful on this point, and not to leave them too soon,
nor break off their conversation and intercourse with their
acquaintances at the exasperating and painful stage.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_201a" id="Page_201a">HOW A MAN MAY BE BENEFITED
BY HIS ENEMIES.</a></h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> I am well aware, Cornelius
Pulcher, that you prefer the mildest manners in public life, by
which you can be at once most useful to the community, and most
agreeable in <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id=
"Page_202">202</a></span>private life to those who have any
dealings with you. But since it is difficult to find any region
without wild beasts, though it is related of Crete;<a name=
"FNanchor_497_497" id="FNanchor_497_497"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_497_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> and hitherto there has
been no state that has not suffered from envy, rivalry, and strife,
the most fruitful seeds of hostility; (for, even if nothing else
does, our friendships involve us in enmities, as Chilo<a name=
"FNanchor_498_498" id="FNanchor_498_498"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_498_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> the wise man
perceived, who asked the man who told him he had no enemy, whether
he had a friend either), it seems to me that a public man ought not
only to examine the whole question of enemies in its various
ramifications, but also to listen to the serious remark of
Xenophon,<a name="FNanchor_499_499" id="FNanchor_499_499"></a><a
href="#Footnote_499_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> that a sensible
man will receive profit even from his enemies. The ideas therefore
that lately occurred to me to deliver, I have now put together
nearly in the identical words and send them to you, with the
exception of some matter also in "Political Precepts,"<a name=
"FNanchor_500_500" id="FNanchor_500_500"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_500_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> a treatise which I
have often noticed in your hands.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> People in old times were
well satisfied if they were not injured by strange and wild beasts,
and that was the only motive of their fights with them, but those
of later days have by now learnt to make use of them, for they feed
on their flesh, and clothe themselves with their wool, and make
medical use of their gall and beestings, and turn their hides into
shields, so that we might reasonably fear, if beasts failed man,
that his life would become brutish, and wild, and void of
resources. Similarly since all others are satisfied with not being
injured by their enemies, but the sensible will also (as Xenophon
says) get profit out of them, we must not be incredulous, but seek
a method and plan how to obtain this advantage, seeing that life
without an enemy is impossible. The husbandman cannot cultivate
every tree, nor can the hunter tame every kind of animal, so both
seek means to derive profit according to their several necessities,
the one from his barren trees, the other from his wild animals.
Sea-water also is undrinkable and brackish, but it feeds fish, and
is a sort of vehicle to convey and transport travellers anywhere.
The Satyr, when he <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id=
"Page_203">203</a></span>saw fire for the first time, wished to
kiss it and embrace it, but Prometheus warned him,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Goat, thou wilt surely mourn
thy loss of beard."<a name="FNanchor_501_501" id=

</div>

<p>For fire burns whoever touches it, but it also gives light and
warmth, and is an instrument of art to all those who know how to
use it.<a name="FNanchor_502_502" id="FNanchor_502_502"></a><a
href="#Footnote_502_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> Consider also in
the case of the enemy, if he is in other respects injurious and
intractable, he somehow or other gives us a handle to make use of
him by, and so is serviceable. And many things are unpleasant and
detestable and antagonistic to those to whom they happen, but you
must have noticed that some use even illnesses as a period of rest
for the body, and others by excessive toil have strengthened and
trained their bodily vigour, and some have made exile and the loss
of money a passage to leisure and philosophy, as did Diogenes and
Crates. And Zeno, when he heard of the wreck of the ship which
contained all his property, said, "Thou hast done well, Fortune, to
confine me to my threadbare cloak."<a name="FNanchor_503_503" id=
"FNanchor_503_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_503" class=
"fnanchor">503</a></p>

<p>For as those animals that have the strongest and healthiest
stomachs eat and digest serpents and scorpions, and some even feed
on stones and shells, which they convert into nourishment by the
strength and heat of their stomachs, while fastidious people out of
health almost vomit if offered bread and wine, so foolish people
spoil even their friendships, while the wise know how to turn to
account even their enmities.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> In the first place then
it seems to me that what is most injurious in enmity may become
most useful to those that pay attention to it? To what do I refer?
Why, to the way in which your enemy ever wide awake pries into all
your affairs, and analyzes your whole life, trying to get a handle
against you somewhere, able not only to look through a tree, like
Lynceus,<a name="FNanchor_504_504" id="FNanchor_504_504"></a><a
href="#Footnote_504_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> or through stones
and shells, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id=
"Page_204">204</a></span>but through your friend and domestic and
every intimate acquaintance, as far as possible detecting your
doings, and digging and ferreting into your designs. For our
friends are ill and often die without our knowing anything about it
through our delay and carelessness, but we almost pry into even the
dreams of our enemies; and our enemy knows even more than we do
ourselves of our diseases and debts and differences with our
wives.<a name="FNanchor_505_505" id="FNanchor_505_505"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_505_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> But they pay most
attention to our faults and hunt them out: and as vultures follow
the scent of putrid carcases, and cannot perceive sound and
wholesome ones, so the diseases and vices and crimes of life
attract the enemy, and on these those that hate us pounce, these
they attack and tear to pieces. Is not this an advantage to us?
Certainly it is. For it teaches us to live warily and be on our
guard, and neither to do or say anything carelessly or without
circumspection, but ever to be vigilant by careful mode of living
that we give no handle to an enemy. For the cautiousness that thus
represses the passions and follows reason implants a care and
determination to live well and without reproach. For as those
states that have been sobered by wars with their neighbours and
continual campaigns love the blessings of order and peace, so those
people who are compelled to lead a sober life owing to their
enemies, and to be on their guard against carelessness and
negligence, and to do everything with an eye to utility,
imperceptibly glide into a faultless mode of life, and tone down
their character, even without requiring much assistance from
precepts. For those who always remember the line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Ah! how would Priam and his
sons rejoice,"<a name="FNanchor_506_506" id=
"FNanchor_506_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_506" class=
"fnanchor">506</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>are by it diverted from and learn to shun all such things as
their enemies would rejoice and laugh at. Again we see actors<a
name="FNanchor_507_507" id="FNanchor_507_507"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_507_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> and singers on the
stage oftentimes slack and remiss, and not taking sufficient pains
about their performances in the theatres when they have it all to
themselves; but when there is a competition and contest with <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id=
"Page_205">205</a></span>others, they not only wake up but tune
their instruments, and adjust their chords, and play on the flute
with more care. Similarly whoever knows that his enemy is
antagonistic to his life and character, pays more attention to
himself, and watches his behaviour more carefully, and regulates
his life. For it is peculiar to vice to be more afraid of enemies
than friends in regard to our faults. And so Nasica, when some
expressed their opinion that the Roman Republic was now secure,
since Carthage was rased to the ground and Achaia reduced to
slavery, said, "Nay rather we are now in a critical position, since
we have none left to fear or respect."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Consider also that very
philosophical and witty answer of Diogenes to the man who asked,
"How shall I avenge myself on my enemy?" "By becoming a good and
honest man."<a name="FNanchor_508_508" id="FNanchor_508_508"></a><a
href="#Footnote_508_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> Some people are
terribly put about if they see their enemies' horses in a good
condition, or hear their dogs praised; if they see their farm
well-tilled, their garden well-kept, they groan aloud. What a state
think you then they would be in, if you were to exhibit yourself as
a just man, sensible and good, in words excellent, in deeds pure,
in manner of life decorous, "reaping fruit from the deep soil of
the soul, where good counsels grow."<a name="FNanchor_509_509" id=

<p>If you wish to vex the man who hates you, do not abuse him by
calling him a pathick, or effeminate, or intemperate, or a low
fellow, or illiberal; but be yourself a man, and temperate, and
truthful, and kind and just in all your <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>dealings with those you
come across. But if you are tempted to use abuse, mind that you
yourself are very far from what you abuse him for, dive down into
your own soul, look for any rottenness in yourself, lest someone
suggest to you the line of the tragedian,</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>If you say your enemy is uneducated, increase your own love of
learning and industry; if you call him coward, stir up the more
your own spirit and manliness; and if you say he is wanton and
licentious, erase from your own soul any secret trace of the love
of pleasure. For nothing is more disgraceful or more unpleasant
than slander that recoils on the person who sets it in motion; for
as the reflection of light seems most to injure weak eyes, so does
censure when it recoils on the censurer, and is borne out by the
facts. For as the north-east wind attracts clouds, so does a bad
life draw upon itself rebukes.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> Whenever Plato was in
company with people who behaved in an unseemly manner, he used to
say to himself, "Am I such a person as this?"<a name=
"FNanchor_514_514" id="FNanchor_514_514"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_514_514" class="fnanchor">514</a> So he that censures
another man's life, if he straightway examines and mends his own,
directing and turning it into the contrary direction, will get some
advantage from his censure, which will be otherwise idle and
unprofitable. Most people laugh if a bald-pate or hump-back jeer
and mock at others who are so too: it is quite as ridiculous to
jeer and mock if one lies open to retort oneself, as Leo of
Byzantium showed in his answer to the hump-back who jeered at him
for weakness of eyes, "You twit me with an infirmity natural to
man, while you yourself carry your Nemesis on your back."<a name=
"FNanchor_515_515" id="FNanchor_515_515"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_515_515" class="fnanchor">515</a> And so do not abuse
another as an adulterer, if you yourself are mad after boys: nor as
a spendthrift, if you yourself are niggardly. Alcm&aelig;on said to
Adrastus, "You are near kinsman to a woman that slew her husband."
What <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id=
"Page_207">207</a></span>was his reply? He retaliated on him with
the appropriate retort, "But you killed with your own hand the
mother that bare you."<a name="FNanchor_516_516" id=
"FNanchor_516_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_516" class=

for the lamprey that was bred in your fishpond, and died?" To which
Crassus replied, "Did you weep, when you buried your three wives?"
He therefore that intends to abuse others must not be witty and
noisy and impudent, but a man that does not lie open to
counter-abuse and retort, for the god seems to have enjoined upon
no one the precept "Know thyself" so much as on the person who is
censorious, to prevent people saying just what they please, and
hearing what don't please them. For such a one is wont, as
Sophocles<a name="FNanchor_517_517" id="FNanchor_517_517"></a><a
href="#Footnote_517_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> says, "idly
letting his tongue flow, to hear against his will, what he
willingly says ill of others."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> This use and advantage
then there is in abusing one's enemy, and no less arises from being
abused and ill-spoken of oneself by one's enemies. And so
Antisthenes<a name="FNanchor_518_518" id="FNanchor_518_518"></a><a
href="#Footnote_518_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> said well that
those who wish to lead a good life ought to have genuine friends or
red-hot enemies; for the former deterred you from what was wrong by
reproof, the latter by abuse. But since friendship has nowadays
become very mealy-mouthed in freedom of speech, voluble in flattery
and silent in rebuke, we can only hear the truth from our enemies.
For as Telephus<a name="FNanchor_519_519" id=
"FNanchor_519_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_519" class=
"fnanchor">519</a> having no surgeon of his own, submitted his
wound to be cured by his enemy's spear, so those who cannot procure
friendly rebuke must content themselves with the censure of an
enemy that hates them, reprehending and castigating their vices,
and regard not the animus of the person, but only his matter. For
as he who intended to kill the Thessalian Prometheus<a name=
"FNanchor_520_520" id="FNanchor_520_520"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_520_520" class="fnanchor">520</a> <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>only
stabbed a tumour, and so lanced it that the man's life was saved,
and he was rid of the tumour by its bursting, so oftentimes abuse,
suddenly thrust on a man in anger or hatred, has cured some disease
in his soul which he was ignorant of or neglected. But most people
when they are abused do not consider whether the abuse really
belongs to them properly, but look round to see what abuse they can
heap on the abuser, and, as wrestlers get smothered with the dust
of the arena, do not wipe off the abuse hurled at themselves, but
bespatter others, and at last get on both sides grimy and
discoloured. But if anyone gets a bad name from an enemy, he ought
to clear himself of the imputation even more than he would remove
any stain on his clothes that was pointed out to him; and if it be
wholly untrue, yet he ought to investigate what originated the
charge, and to be on his guard and be afraid lest he had unawares
done something very near akin to what was imputed to him. As
Lacydes, the king of the Argives, by the way he wore his hair and
by his mincing walk got charged with effeminacy: and Pompey's
scratching his head with one finger was construed in the same way,
though both these men were very far from effeminacy or wantonness.
And Crassus was accused of an intrigue with one of the Vestal
Virgins, because he wished to purchase from her a pleasant estate,
and therefore frequently visited her and waited upon her. And
Postumia, from her readiness to laugh and talk somewhat freely with
men, got accused and even had to stand her trial for incest,<a
name="FNanchor_521_521" id="FNanchor_521_521"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_521_521" class="fnanchor">521</a> but was, however,
acquitted of that charge: but Spurius Minucius the Pontif ex
Maximus, when he pronounced her innocent, urged her not to be freer
in her words than she was in her life. And though Themistocles<a
name="FNanchor_522_522" id="FNanchor_522_522"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_522_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> was guiltless of
treason, his intimacy with Pausanias, and the letters and messages
that frequently passed between them, laid him under suspicion.</p>

<p><a name="Page_208a" id="Page_208a"></a>&sect; <span class=
"smcap">vii.</span> Whenever therefore any false charge is made
against us, we ought not merely to despise and neglect it as false,
but to see what word or action, either in jest or earnest, has made
the charge seem probable, and this we <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>must for the future be
earnestly on our guard against and shun. For if others falling into
unforeseen trouble and difficulties teach us what is expedient, as
Merope says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Fortune has made me wise,
though she has ta'en</span> <span class="i0">My dearest ones as
wages,"<a name="FNanchor_523_523" id="FNanchor_523_523"></a><a
href="#Footnote_523_523" class="fnanchor">523</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>why should we not take an enemy, and pay him no wages, to teach
us, and give us profit and instruction, in matters which had
escaped our notice? For an enemy has keener perception than a
friend, for, as Plato<a name="FNanchor_524_524" id=
"FNanchor_524_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_524" class=
"fnanchor">524</a> says, "the lover is blind as respects the loved
one," and hatred is both curious and talkative. Hiero was twitted
by one of his enemies for his foul breath, so he went home and said
to his wife, "How is this? You never told me of it." But she being
chaste and innocent replied, "I thought all men's breath was like
that."<a name="FNanchor_525_525" id="FNanchor_525_525"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_525_525" class="fnanchor">525</a> Thus perceptible and
material things, and things that are plain to everybody, are sooner
learnt from enemies than from friends and intimates.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> Moreover to keep the
tongue well under control, no small factor in moral excellence, and
to make it always obedient and submissive to reason, is not
possible, unless by practice and attention and painstaking a man
has subdued his worst passions, as for example anger. For such
expressions as "a word uttered involuntarily," and "escaping the
barrier of the teeth,"<a name="FNanchor_526_526" id=
"FNanchor_526_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_526" class=
"fnanchor">526</a> and "words darting forth spontaneously," well
illustrate what happens in the case of ill-disciplined souls, ever
wavering and in an unsettled condition through infirmity of temper,
through unbridled fancy, or through faulty education. But,
according to divine Plato,<a name="FNanchor_527_527" id=
"FNanchor_527_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_527" class=
"fnanchor">527</a> though a word seems a very trivial matter, the
heaviest penalty follows upon it both from gods and men. But
silence can never be called to account, is not only not thirsty, to
borrow the language of Hippocrates, but when abused is dignified
and Socratic, or rather Herculean, if indeed it was Hercules who
said,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Sharp words he heeded not so
much as flies."<a name="FNanchor_528_528" id=
"FNanchor_528_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_528" class=
"fnanchor">528</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id=
"Page_210">210</a></span>Not more dignified and noble than this is
it to keep silent when an enemy reviles you, "as one swims by a
smooth and mocking cliff," but in practice it is better. If you
accustom yourself to bear silently the abuse of an enemy, you will
very easily bear the attack of a scolding wife, and will remain
undisturbed when you hear the sharp language of a friend or
brother, and will be calm and placid when you are beaten or have
something thrown at your head by your father or mother. For
Socrates put up with Xanthippe, a passionate and forward woman,
which made him a more easy companion with others, as being
accustomed to submit to her caprices; and it is far better to train
and accustom the temper to bear quietly the insults and rages and
jeers and taunts of enemies and estranged persons, and not to be
distressed at it.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> Thus then must we exhibit
in our enmities meekness and forbearance, and in our friendships
still more simplicity and magnanimity and kindness. For it is not
so graceful to do a friend a service, as disgraceful to refuse to
do so at his request; and not to revenge oneself on an enemy when
opportunity offers is generous. But the man who sympathizes with
his enemy in affliction, and assists him in distress, and readily
holds out a helping hand to his children and family and their
fortunes when in a low condition, whoever does not admire such a
man for his humanity, and praise his benevolence,</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>When C&aelig;sar ordered the statues of Pompey that had been
thrown down to be put up again,<a name="FNanchor_530_530" id=
"FNanchor_530_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_530" class=
"fnanchor">530</a> Cicero said, "You have set up again Pompey's
statues, and in so doing have erected statues to yourself." We
ought not therefore to be niggardly in our praise and honour of an
enemy that deserves a good name. For he who praises another
receives on that account greater praise himself, and is the more
credited on another occasion when he finds fault, as not having any
personal ill-feeling against the man, but only <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id=
"Page_211">211</a></span>disapproving of his act; and what is most
noble and advantageous, the man who is accustomed to praise his
enemies, and not to be vexed or malignant at their prosperity, is
as far as possible from envying the good fortune of his friends,
and the success of his intimates. And yet what practice will be
more beneficial to our minds, or bring about a happier disposition,
than that which banishes from us all jealousy and envy? For as in
war many necessary things, otherwise bad, are customary and have as
it were the sanction of law, so that they cannot be abolished in
spite of the injury they do, so enmity drags along in its train
hatred, and envy, and jealousy, and malignity, and revenge, and
stamps them on the character. Moreover knavery, and deceit, and
villainy, that seem neither bad nor unfair if employed against an
enemy, if they once get planted in the mind are difficult to
dislodge; and eventually from force of habit get used also against
friends, unless they are forewarned and forearmed through their
previous acquaintance with the tricks of enemies. If then
Pythagoras,<a name="FNanchor_531_531" id="FNanchor_531_531"></a><a
href="#Footnote_531_531" class="fnanchor">531</a> accustoming his
disciples to abstain from all cruelty and inhumanity to the brute
creation, did right to discountenance bird-fowling, and to buy up
draughts of fishes and bid them be thrown into the water again, and
to forbid killing any but wild animals, much more noble is it, in
dissensions and differences with human beings, to be a generous,
just and true enemy, and to check and tame all bad and low and
knavish propensities, that in all intercourse with friends a man
may keep the peace and abstain from doing an injury. Scaurus was an
enemy and accuser of Domitius, but when one of Domitius' slaves
came to him to reveal some important matters which were unknown to
Scaurus, he would not hear him, but seized him and sent him back to
his master. And when Cato was prosecuting Murena for canvassing,
and was getting together his evidence, he was accompanied as was
usual by people who watched what he was doing,<a name=
"FNanchor_532_532" id="FNanchor_532_532"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_532_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> and would often ask
him if he intended that day to get together his witnesses and open
the case, and if he said "No," they believed him and went <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id=
"Page_212">212</a></span>their way. All this is the greatest proof
of the credit which was reposed in Cato, but it is better and more
important, that we should accustom ourselves to deal justly even
with our enemies, and then there will be no fear that we should
ever act unjustly and treacherously to our friends and
intimates.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> But since, as Simonides
says, "all larks must have their crests,"<a name="FNanchor_533_533"
id="FNanchor_533_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_533" class=
"fnanchor">533</a> and every man's nature contains in it pugnacity
and jealousy and envy, which last is, as Pindar says, "the
companion of empty-headed men," one might get considerable
advantage by purging oneself of those passions against enemies, and
by diverting them, like sewers, as far as possible from companions
and friends.<a name="FNanchor_534_534" id="FNanchor_534_534"></a><a
href="#Footnote_534_534" class="fnanchor">534</a> And this it seems
the statesmanlike Onomademus had remarked, for being on the
victorious side in a disturbance at Chios, he urged his party not
to expel all of the different faction, but to leave some, "in
order," he said, "that we may not begin to quarrel with our
friends, when we have got entirely rid of our enemies." So too our
expending these passions entirely on our enemies will give less
trouble to our friends. For it ought not to be, as Hesiod<a name=
"FNanchor_535_535" id="FNanchor_535_535"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_535_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> says, that "potter
envies potter, and singer envies singer, and neighbour neighbour,"
and cousin cousin, and brother brother, "if hastening to get rich"
and enjoying prosperity. But if there is no other way to get rid of
strife and envy and quarrels, accustom yourself to be vexed at your
enemies' good fortune, and sharpen and accentuate on them your
acerbity. For as judicious gardeners think they produce finer roses
and violets by planting alongside of them garlic and onions, that
any bitter or strong elements may be transferred to them, so your
enemy's getting and attracting your envy and malignity will render
you kinder and more agreeable to your prosperous friends. And so
let us be rivals of our enemies for glory or office or righteous
gain, not only being vexed if they get ahead of us, but also
carefully observing all the steps by which they get ahead, and
trying to outdo <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id=
"Page_213">213</a></span>them in industry, and hard work, and
soberness, and prudence; as Themistocles said Miltiades' victory at
Marathon would not let him sleep.<a name="FNanchor_536_536" id=
"FNanchor_536_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_536" class=
"fnanchor">536</a> For he who thinks his enemy gets before him in
offices, or advocacies, or state affairs, or in favour with his
friends or great men, if from action and emulation he sinks into
envy and despondency, makes his life become idle and inoperative.
But he who is not blinded by hate,<a name="FNanchor_537_537" id=
"FNanchor_537_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_537" class=
"fnanchor">537</a> but a discerning spectator of life and character
and words and deeds, will perceive that most of what he envies
comes to those who have them from diligence and prudence and good
actions, and exerting himself in the same direction he will
increase his love of what is honourable and noble, and will
eradicate his vanity and sloth.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xi.</span> But if our enemies seem to
us to have got either by flattery, or fraud, or bribery, or venal
services, ill-got and discreditable power at court or in state, it
ought not to trouble us but rather inspire pleasure in us, when we
compare our own liberty and purity and independence of life. For,
as Plato<a name="FNanchor_538_538" id="FNanchor_538_538"></a><a
href="#Footnote_538_538" class="fnanchor">538</a> says, "all the
gold above or below the earth is not of equal value with virtue."
And we ought ever to remember the precept of Solon, "We will not
exchange our virtue for others' wealth."<a name="FNanchor_539_539"
id="FNanchor_539_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_539" class=
"fnanchor">539</a> Nor will we give up our virtue for the applause
of banqueting theatres, nor for honours and chief seats among
eunuchs and harlots, nor to be monarchs' satraps; for nothing is to
be desired or noble that comes from what is bad. But since, as
Plato<a name="FNanchor_540_540" id="FNanchor_540_540"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_540_540" class="fnanchor">540</a> says, "the lover is
blind as respects the loved one," and we notice more what our
enemies do amiss, we ought not to let either our joy at their
faults or our grief at their success be idle, but in either case we
ought to reflect, how we may become better than them by avoiding
their errors, and by imitating their virtues not come short of
them.</p>

<h3>ON TALKATIVENESS.<a name="FNanchor_541_541" id=
"FNanchor_541_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_541" class=
"fnanchor">541</a></h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Philosophy finds
talkativeness a disease very difficult and hard to cure. For its
remedy, conversation, requires hearers: but talkative people hear
nobody, for they are ever prating. And the first evil this
inability to keep silence produces is an inability to listen. It is
a self-chosen deafness of people who, I take it, blame nature for
giving us one tongue and two ears. If then the following advice of
Euripides to a foolish hearer was good,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I cannot fill one that can
nought retain,</span> <span class="i0">Pumping up wise words for an
unwise man;"</span></div>
</div>

<p>one might more justly say to a talkative man, or rather about a
talkative man,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I cannot fill one that will
nothing take,</span> <span class="i0">Pumping up wise words for an
unwise man;"</span></div>
</div>

<p>or rather deluging with words one that talks to those who don't
listen, and listens not to those who talk. Even if he does listen
for a short time, talkativeness hurries off what is said like the
retiring sea, and anon brings it up again multiplied with the
approaching tide. The portico at Olympia that returns many echoes
to one utterance is called seven-voiced,<a name="FNanchor_542_542"
id="FNanchor_542_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_542" class=
"fnanchor">542</a> and if the slightest utterance catches the ear
of talkativeness, it at once echoes it all round,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Moving the mind's chords all
unmoved before."<a name="FNanchor_543_543" id=
"FNanchor_543_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_543" class=
"fnanchor">543</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>For their ears can certainly have no passages leading to the
brain but only to the tongue. And so while other people retain what
they hear, talkative people lose it altogether, and, being
empty-headed, they resemble empty vessels, and go about making much
noise.<a name="FNanchor_544_544" id="FNanchor_544_544"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_544_544" class="fnanchor">544</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id=
"Page_215">215</a></span>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> If
however it seems that no attempt at cure has been left untried, let
us say to the talkative person,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Be silent, boy; silence has
great advantages;"</span></div>
</div>

<p>two of the first and foremost of which are hearing and being
heard, neither of which can happen to talkative people, for however
they desire either so unhappy are they that they must desist from
it. For in all other diseases of the soul, as love of money, love
of glory, or love of pleasure, people at any rate attain the
desired object: but it is the cruel fate of talkative people to
desire hearers but not to get them, for everyone flees from them
with headlong speed; and if people are sitting or walking about in
any public place,<a name="FNanchor_545_545" id=
"FNanchor_545_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_545" class=
"fnanchor">545</a> and see one coming they quickly pass the word to
one another to shift quarters. And as when there is dead silence in
any assembly they say Hermes has joined the company, so when any
prater joins some drinking party or social gathering of friends,
all are silent, not wishing to give him a chance to break in, and
if he uninvited begin to open his mouth, they all, "like before a
storm at sea, when Boreas is blowing a gale round some headland,"
foreseeing tossing about and nausea, disperse. And so it is their
destiny to find neither willing table-companions, nor messmates
when they are travelling by land or by sea, but only such as cannot
help themselves; for such a fellow is always at you, plucking hold
of your clothes or chin, or giving you a dig in the ribs with his
elbow. "Most valuable are the feet in such a conjuncture,"
according to Archilochus, nay according to the wise Aristotle
himself. For he being bothered with a talkative fellow, and wearied
out with his absurd tales, and his frequent question, "Is not this
wonderful, Aristotle?" "Not at all," said he, "but it is wonderful
that anyone with a pair of legs stops here to listen to you." And
to another such fellow, who said after a long rigmarole, "Did I
weary you, philosopher, by my chatter?" "Not you, by Zeus," said
he, "for I paid no attention to you." For <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>even if talkative
people force you to listen,<a name="FNanchor_546_546" id=
"FNanchor_546_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_546" class=
"fnanchor">546</a> the mind can give them only its outward ears to
deluge, while it unfolds and pursues some other thoughts within; so
they find neither hearers to attend to them, nor credit them. They
say those that are prone to Venus are commonly barren: so the
prating of talkative people is ineffectual and fruitless.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> And yet nature has fenced
and barricaded in us nothing so much as the tongue, having put the
teeth before it as a barrier, so that if, when reason holds tight
her "glossy reins,"<a name="FNanchor_547_547" id=
"FNanchor_547_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_547" class=
"fnanchor">547</a> it hearken not, nor keep within bounds, we may
check its intemperance, biting it till the blood comes. For
Euripides tells us that, not from unbolted houses or store-rooms,
but "from unbridled mouths the end is misfortune."<a name=
"FNanchor_548_548" id="FNanchor_548_548"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_548_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> But those persons who
think that houses without doors and open purses are no good to
their possessors, and yet keep their mouths open and unshut, and
allow their speech to flow continually like the waves of the
Euxine,<a name="FNanchor_549_549" id="FNanchor_549_549"></a><a
href="#Footnote_549_549" class="fnanchor">549</a> seem to regard
speech as of less value than anything. And so they never get
believed, though credit is the aim of every speech; for to inspire
belief in one's hearers is the proper end of speech, but praters
are disbelieved even when they tell the truth. For as corn stowed
away in a granary is found to be larger in quantity but inferior in
quality, so the speech of a talkative man is increased by a large
addition of falsehood, which destroys his credit.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Then again every man of
modesty and propriety would avoid drunkenness, for anger is next
door neighbour to madness as some think,<a name="FNanchor_550_550"
id="FNanchor_550_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_550" class=
"fnanchor">550</a> but drunkenness lives in the same house: or
rather drunkenness is madness, more short-lived indeed, but more
potent also through volition, for it is self-chosen. Nor is
drunkenness censured for anything so much as its intemperate and
endless talk.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id=

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Wine makes a prudent man
begin to sing,</span> <span class="i0">And gently laugh, and even
makes him dance."<a name="FNanchor_551_551" id=
"FNanchor_551_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_551" class=
"fnanchor">551</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>And yet there is no harm in all this, in singing and laughing
and dancing. But the poet adds&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"And it compels to say what's
best unsaid."<a name="FNanchor_552_552" id=

</div>

<p>This is indeed dreadful and dangerous. And perhaps the poet in
this passage has solved that problem of the philosophers, and
stated the difference between being under the influence of wine and
being drunk, mirth being the condition of the former, foolish talk
of the latter. For as the proverb tells us, "What is in the heart
of the sober is on the tongue of the drunken."<a name=
"FNanchor_553_553" id="FNanchor_553_553"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_553_553" class="fnanchor">553</a> And so Bias, being
silent at a drinking bout, and jeered at by some young man in the
company as stupid, replied, "What fool could hold his tongue in
liquor?" And at Athens a certain person gave an entertainment to
the king's ambassadors, and at their desire contrived to get the
philosophers there too, and as they were all talking together and
comparing ideas, and Zeno alone was silent, the strangers greeted
him and pledged him, and said, "What are we to tell the king about
you, Zeno?" And he replied, "Nothing, but that there is an old man
at Athens that can hold his tongue at a drinking bout." So profound
and mysterious and sober is silence, while drunkenness is
talkative: for it is void of sense and understanding, and so is
loquacious. And so the philosophers define drunkenness to be silly
talk in wine. Drinking therefore is not censured, if silence go
with it, but foolish prating turns being under the influence of
wine into drunkenness. And the drunken man prates only in his cups;
but the talkative man prates everywhere, in the market-place, in
the theatre, out walking, by night and by day. If he is your
doctor, he is more trouble to you than your disease: if he is on
board ship with you, he disgusts you more than sea-sickness; if he
praises you, he is more fulsome than blame. It is more pleasure
associating with bad men who have tact than with good men who
prate. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id=
"Page_218">218</a></span>Nestor indeed in Sophocles' Play, trying
by his words to soothe exasperated Ajax, said to him mildly,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I blame you not, for though
your words are bad,</span> <span class="i0">Your acts are
good:"</span></div>
</div>

<p>but we cannot feel so to the talkative man, for his want of tact
in words destroys and undoes all the grace of his actions.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> Lysias wrote a defence for
some accused person, and gave it him, and he read it several times,
and came to Lysias in great dejection and said, "When I first
perused this defence, it seemed to me wonderful, but when I read it
a second and third time, it seemed altogether dull and ineffective.
Then Lysias laughed, and said, "What then? Are you going to read it
more than once to the jury?" And yet do but consider the
persuasiveness and grace of Lysias' style;<a name=
"FNanchor_554_554" id="FNanchor_554_554"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_554_554" class="fnanchor">554</a> for he "I say was a
great favourite with the dark-haired Muses."<a name=
"FNanchor_555_555" id="FNanchor_555_555"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_555_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> And of the things
which have been said of Homer the truest is that he alone of all
poets has survived the fastidiousness of mankind, as being ever new
and still at his acme as regards giving pleasure, and yet saying
and proclaiming about himself, "I hate to spin out a plain tale
over and over again,"<a name="FNanchor_556_556" id=
"FNanchor_556_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_556" class=
"fnanchor">556</a> he avoids and fears that satiety which lies in
ambush for every narrative, and takes the hearer from one subject
to another, and relieves by novelty the possibility of being
surfeited. But the talkative worry one's ears to death with their
tautologies, as people scribble the same things over and over again
on palimpsests.<a name="FNanchor_557_557" id=
"FNanchor_557_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_557" class=
"fnanchor">557</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> Let us remind them then
first of this, that just as in the case of wine, which was intended
for pleasure and mirth, those who compel people to drink it neat
and in large quantities bring some into a disgusting condition of
drunkenness, so with speech, which is the pleasantest social tie
amongst <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id=
"Page_219">219</a></span>mankind, those who make a bad and
ill-advised use of it render it unpleasing and unfit for company,
paining those whom they think to gratify, and become a
laughing-stock to those who they think admire them, and
objectionable to those who they think love them. As then he cannot
be a favourite of the goddess who with Aphrodite's charmed girdle<a
name="FNanchor_558_558" id="FNanchor_558_558"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_558_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> repels and drives away
those who associate with him, so he who with his speech bores and
disgusts one is without either taste or refinement.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> Of all other passions and
disorders some are dangerous, some hateful, some ridiculous, but in
talkativeness all these elements are combined. For praters are
jeered at for their commonplaces, and hated when they bring bad
news, and run into danger when they reveal secrets. And so
Anacharsis, when he was feasted by Solon and lay down to sleep, and
was observed with his left hand on his private parts, and his right
hand on his mouth, for he thought his tongue needed the stronger
restraint, was right in his opinion. For it would be difficult to
find as many men who have been ruined by venereal excesses as
cities and leading states that have been undone by the utterance of
a secret. When Sulla was besieging Athens, and had no time to waste
there, "for he had other fish to fry,"<a name="FNanchor_559_559"
id="FNanchor_559_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_559" class=
"fnanchor">559</a> as Mithridates was ravaging Asia, and the party
of Marius was again in power at Rome, some old men in a barber's
shop happened to observe to one another that the Heptachalcon was
not well guarded, and that their city ran a great risk of being
captured at that point, and some spies who overheard this
conversation reported it to Sulla. And he at once marched up his
forces, and about midnight entered the city with his army, and all
but rased it to the ground, and filled it with slaughter and dead
bodies, insomuch that the Ceramicus ran with blood: and he was thus
savage against the Athenians for their words rather than their
deeds, for they had spoken ill of him and his wife Metella, jumping
on to the walls and calling out in a jeering way,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Sulla is a mulberry bestrewn
with barley meal,"</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id=
"Page_220">220</a></span>and much similar banter. Thus they drew
down upon themselves for words, which, as Plato<a name=
"FNanchor_560_560" id="FNanchor_560_560"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_560_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> says, are a very small
matter, a very heavy punishment.<a name="FNanchor_561_561" id=
"FNanchor_561_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_561" class=
"fnanchor">561</a> The prating of one man also prevented Rome from
becoming free by the removal of Nero. For it was only the night
before the tyrant was to be murdered, and all preparations had been
made, when he that was to do the deed going to the theatre, and
seeing someone in chains near the doors who was about to be taken
before Nero, and was bewailing his sad fortune, went up close to
him and whispered, "Pray only, good sir, that to-day may pass by,
to-morrow you will owe me many thanks." He guessing the meaning of
the riddle, and thinking, I take it, "he is a fool who gives up
what is in his hand for a remote contingency,"<a name=
"FNanchor_562_562" id="FNanchor_562_562"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_562_562" class="fnanchor">562</a> preferred certain to
honourable safety. For he informed Nero of what the man had said,
and he was immediately arrested, and torture, and fire, and
scourging were applied to him, who denied now in his necessity what
before he had divulged without necessity.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> Zeno the philosopher,<a
name="FNanchor_563_563" id="FNanchor_563_563"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_563_563" class="fnanchor">563</a> that he might not
against his will divulge any secrets when put to the torture, bit
off his tongue, and spit it at the tyrant. Famous also was the
reward which Le&aelig;na had for her taciturnity.<a name=
"FNanchor_564_564" id="FNanchor_564_564"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_564_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> She was the mistress
of Harmodius and Aristogiton, and, although a woman, participated
in their hopes of success in the conspiracy against the tyrants:
for she had revelled in the glorious cup of love, and had been
initiated in their secrets through the god. When then they had
failed in their attempt and been put to death, and she was examined
and bidden to reveal the names of the other conspirators, she
refused to do so, and held out to the end, showing that those
famous men in loving such a one as her had done nothing unworthy of
them. And the Athenians erected to her <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>memory a bronze lioness
without a tongue, and placed it near the entrance to the Acropolis,
signifying her dauntless courage by the nobleness of that animal,
and by its being without a tongue her silence and fidelity. For no
spoken word has done as much good as many unspoken ones. For at
some future day we can give utterance if we like to what has been
not said, but a word once spoken cannot be recalled, but flies
about and runs all round the world. And this is the reason, I take
it, why men teach us to speak, but the gods teach us to be silent,
silence being enjoined on us in the mysteries and in all religious
rites. Thus Homer has described the most eloquent Odysseus, and
Telemachus, and Penelope, and the nurse, as all remarkable for
their taciturnity. You remember the nurse saying,</p>

his companions, for though they were dashed to the ground and

speaking plainly about herself, says she knows "how to be silent
when she should, and to speak when speech is safe."<a name=
"FNanchor_570_570" id="FNanchor_570_570"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_570_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> For those who have
enjoyed a truly noble and royal education learn first to be silent
and then to speak. So the famous king Antigonus, when his son asked
him, "When are we going to shift our quarters?" answered, "Are you
afraid that you only will not hear the trumpet?" Was he afraid then
to entrust a secret to him, to whom he intended one day to leave
his kingdom? Nay rather, it was to teach him to be close and
guarded on such matters. Metellus<a name="FNanchor_571_571" id=
"FNanchor_571_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_571" class=
"fnanchor">571</a> also, the well-known veteran, when questioned
somewhat similarly about an expedition, said, "If I thought my coat
knew the secret, I would strip it off and throw it into the fire."
And Eumenes, when he heard that Craterus was marching against him,
told none of his friends, but pretended that it was Neoptolemus;
for his soldiers despised Neoptolemus, but they admired the glory
and loved the virtue of Craterus; and no one but Eumenes knew the
truth, and they engaged and were victorious, and unwittingly killed
Craterus, and only recognized his dead body. So great a part did
silence play in the battle, concealing the name of the enemy's
general: so that Eumenes' friends marvelled more than found fault
at his not having told them the truth. And if anyone should receive
blame in such a case, it is better to be censured when one has done
well by keeping one's counsel, rather than to have to accuse others
through having come to grief by trusting them.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> But, generally speaking,
who has the right to blame the person who has not kept his secret?
For if it was not to be known, it was not well to tell another
person of it at <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id=
"Page_223">223</a></span>all, and if you divulged your secret
yourself and expected another person to keep it, you had more faith
in another than in yourself. And so should he be such another as
yourself you are deservedly undone, and should he be a better man
than yourself, your safety is more than you could have reckoned on,
as it involved finding a man more to be trusted than yourself. But
you will say, He is my friend. Yes, but he has another friend, whom
he reposes confidence in as much as you do in your friend, and that
other friend has one of his own, and so on, so that the secret
spreads in many quarters from inability to keep it close in one.
For as the unit never deviates from its orbit, but (as its name
signifies) always remains one, but the number two contains within
it the seeds of infinity, for when it departs from itself it
becomes plurality at once by doubling, so speech confined in one
person's breast is truly secret, but if it be communicated to
another it soon gets noised abroad. And so Homer calls words
"winged," for as he that lets a bird go from his hands cannot
easily get it back again, so he that lets a word go from his mouth
cannot catch or stop it, but it is borne along "whirling on swift
wings," and dispersed from one person to another. When a ship scuds
before the gale the mariners can stop it, or at least check its
course with cables and anchors, but when the spoken word once sails
out of harbour, so to speak, there is no roadstead or anchorage for
it, but borne along with much noise and echo it dashes its utterer
on the rocks, and brings him into imminent danger of shipwreck,</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xi.</span> The Roman Senate had been
discussing for several days a secret matter, and there was much
doubt and suspicion about it. And one of the senator's wives,
discreet in other matters but a very woman in curiosity, pressed
her husband close, and entreated him to tell her what the secret
was; she vowed and swore she would not divulge it, and did not
refrain from shedding tears at her not being trusted. And he,
nothing loth to convince her of her folly, <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>said, "Your
importunity, wife, has prevailed, listen to a dreadful and
portentous matter. It has been told us by the priests that a lark
has been seen flying in the air with a golden helmet and spear: it
is this portent that we are considering and discussing with the
augurs, as to whether it be a good or bad omen. But say nothing
about it." Having said these words he went into the Forum. But his
wife seized on the very first of her maids that entered the room,
and smote her breast, and tore her hair, and said, "Alas! for my
husband and country! What will become of us?" wishing and teaching
her maid to say, "Whatever's up?" So when she inquired she told her
all about it, adding that refrain common to all praters, "Tell no
one a word about it." The maid however had scarce left her mistress
when she told one of her fellow-servants who was doing little or
nothing, and she told her lover who happened to call at that
moment. So the news spread to the Forum so quickly that it got the
start of its original author, and one of his friends meeting him
said, "Have you only just left your house?" "Only just," he
replied. "Didn't you hear the news?" said his friend. "What news?"
said he. "Why, that a lark has been seen flying in the air with a
golden helmet and spear, and the Senate are met to discuss the
portent." And he smiled and said to himself, "You are quick, wife,
for the tale to get before me to the Forum!" Then meeting some of
the Senators he disabused them of their panic. But to punish his
wife, he said when he got home, "You have undone me, wife: for the
secret has got abroad from my house, so that I must be an exile
from my country for your inability to keep a secret." And on her
trying to deny it, and saying, "Were there not three hundred
Senators that heard of it as well as you? Might not one of them
have divulged it?" he replied, "Stuff o' your three hundred! It was
at your importunity that I invented the story, to put you to the
test!" This fellow tested his wife warily and cunningly, as one
pours water, and not wine or oil, into a leaky vessel. And

the extinction of his family, how two of his daughter Julia's sons
were dead, and how Posthumus Agrippa, the only remaining one, was
in exile through false accusation,<a name="FNanchor_574_574" id=

the Empire, though he pitied Agrippa and had half a mind to recall
him from banishment, repeated the Emperor's words to his wife, and
she to Livia.<a name="FNanchor_576_576" id=
"FNanchor_576_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_576" class=
"fnanchor">576</a> And Livia bitterly upbraided Augustus, if he
meant recalling his grandson, for not having done so long ago,
instead of bringing her into hatred and hostility with the heir to
the Empire. When Fabius came in the morning as usual into the
Emperor's presence, and said, "Hail, C&aelig;sar!" the Emperor
replied, "Farewell,<a name="FNanchor_577_577" id=
"FNanchor_577_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_577" class=

this straightway went home, and sent for his wife, and said, "The
Emperor knows that I have not kept his secret, so I shall kill
myself." And his wife replied, "You have deserved your fate, since
having been married to me so long you did not remember and guard
against my incontinence of speech, but suffer me to kill myself
first." So saying she took his sword, and slew herself first.</p>

"Whatever you like, O king, except your secrets." And talkativeness
has another plague attached to it, even curiosity: for praters wish
to hear much that they may have much to say, and most of all do
they gad about to investigate and pry into secrets and hidden
things, providing as it were an antiquated stock of rubbish<a name=

Seleucus Callinicus having lost his army and all his forces in a
battle against the Galati, threw off his diadem, and fled on a
swift horse with an escort of three or four of his men a long day's
journey by bypaths and out-of-the-way tracks, till faint and
famishing for want of food he drew rein at a small farmhouse, where
by chance he found the master at home, and asked for some bread and
water. And he supplied him liberally and courteously not only with
what he asked for but with whatever else was on the farm, and
recognized the king, and being very joyful at this opportunity of
ministering to the king's necessities, he could not contain
himself, nor dissemble like the king who wished to be incognito,
but he accompanied him to the road, and on parting from him, said,
"Farewell, king Seleucus." And he stretching out his right hand,
and drawing the man to him as if he was going to kiss him, gave a
sign to one of his escort to draw his sword and cut the man's head
off;</p>

<p>Whereas if he had been silent then, and kept his counsel for a
time, as the king afterwards became prosperous and great, he would
have received, I take it, greater favour for his silence than for
his hospitality. And yet he had I admit some excuse for his want of
reticence, namely hope and joy.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> But most talkative
people have no excuse for ruining themselves. As for example in a
barber's shop one day there was some conversation about the tyranny
of Dionysius, that it was as hard as adamant and invincible, and
the barber laughed and said, "Fancy your saying this to me, who
have my razor at his throat most days!" And Dionysius hearing this
had him crucified. Barbers indeed are generally a talkative race,
for people fond of prating flock to them and sit in their shops, so
that they pick up the habit from their customers. It was a witty
answer <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id=
"Page_227">227</a></span> therefore of king Archelaus,<a name=
"FNanchor_583_583" id="FNanchor_583_583"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_583_583" class="fnanchor">583</a> when a talkative
barber put the towel round his neck, and asked him, "How shall I
shave you, O king?" "Silently," said the monarch. It was a barber
that first spread the news of the great reverse of the Athenians in
Sicily, having heard of it at the Pir&aelig;us from a slave that
had escaped from the island. He at once left his shop, and ran into
the city at full speed, "that no one else should reap the fame, and
he come in the second,"<a name="FNanchor_584_584" id=
"FNanchor_584_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_584" class=
"fnanchor">584</a> of carrying the news into the town. And an
uproar arising, as was only to be expected, the people assembled in
the ecclesia, and began to investigate the origin of the rumour. So
the barber was dragged up and questioned, but knew not the person's
name who had told him, so was obliged to refer its origin to an
anonymous and unknown person. Then anger filled the theatre, and
the multitude cried out, "Torture the cursed fellow, put him to the
rack: he has fabricated and concocted this news: who else heard it?
who credits it?" The wheel was brought, the poor fellow stretched
on it. Meantime those came up who had brought the news, who had
escaped from the carnage in Sicily. Then all the multitude
dispersed to weep over their private sorrows, and abandoned the
poor barber, who remained fastened to the wheel. And when released
late in the evening he actually asked the executioner, if they had
heard how Nicias the General was slain. So invincible and
incorrigible a vice does habit make talkativeness to be.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> And yet, as those that
drink bitter and strong-smelling physic are disgusted even with the
cups they drink it out of, so those that bring evil tidings are
disliked and hated by their hearers. Wittily therefore has
Sophocles described the conversation between Creon and the
guard.</p>

<p>However those that tell the tale grieve us as well as those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id=

means of checking or controlling the running tongue. At
Laced&aelig;mon the temple of Athene Chalci&oelig;cus<a name=
"FNanchor_586_586" id="FNanchor_586_586"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_586_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> was broken into, and
an empty flagon was observed lying on the ground inside, and a
great concourse of people came up and discussed the matter. And one
of the company said, "If you will allow me, I will tell you what I
think about this flagon. I cannot help being of opinion that these
sacrilegious wretches drank hemlock, and brought wine with them,
before commencing their nefarious and dangerous work: that so, if
they should fail to be detected, they might depart in safety,
drinking the wine neat as an antidote to the hemlock: whereas
should they be caught in the act, before they were put to the
torture they would die of the poison easily and painlessly." When
he had uttered these words, the idea seemed so ingenious and
farfetched that it looked as if it could not emanate from fancy,
but only from knowledge of the real facts. So the crowd surrounded
this man, and asked him one after the other, "Who are you? Who
knows you? How come you to know all this?" And at last he was
convicted in this way, and confessed that he was one of those that
had committed the sacrilege. And were not the murderers of Ibycus
similarly captured? They were sitting in the theatre, and some
cranes flew over their heads, and they laughed and whispered to one
another, "Behold the avengers of Ibycus." And this being overheard
by some who sat near, as Ibycus had now been some time missing and
inquired after, they laid hold of this remark, and reported it to
the magistrates. And so they were convicted and dragged off to
punishment, being brought to justice not by the cranes but by their
own inability to hold their tongues, being compelled by some Fury
or Vengeance as it were to divulge the murder.<a name=
"FNanchor_587_587" id="FNanchor_587_587"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_587_587" class="fnanchor">587</a> For as in the body
there is an attraction to sore and suffering parts from
neighbouring parts, so the tongue of talkative persons, ever
suffering from inflammation and a throbbing pulse, attracts and
draws to it secret and hidden things. And so the tongue ought to be
fenced in, and have reason ever before <span class='pagenum'><a

prevent its tripping: that we may not seem to be more silly than
geese, of whom it is said that, when they fly from Cilicia over Mt.
Taurus which swarms with eagles, they carry in their mouths a large
stone, which they employ as a gag or bridle for their scream, and
so they cross over by night unobserved.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> Now if anyone were to ask
who is the worst and most abandoned man, no one would pass over the
traitor, or mention anyone else. It was as the reward of treason
that Euthycrates roofed his house with Macedonian wood, as
Demosthenes tells us; and that Philocrates got a large sum of
money, and spent it on women and fish; and it was for betraying
Eretria that Euphorbus and Philagrus got an estate from king
Philip. But the talkative man is an unhired and officious traitor,
not of horses<a name="FNanchor_588_588" id=
"FNanchor_588_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_588" class=
"fnanchor">588</a> or walls, but of secrets which he divulges in
the law courts, in factions, in party-strife, no one thanking him
for his pains; but should anyone listen to him he thinks he is the
obliged party. So that what was said to a man who rashly and
indiscriminately squandered away all his means and bestowed them on
others,</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>is appropriate also to the prater, "You don't communicate to us
all this out of friendship or goodwill, but it is a disease in you,
this itch for talking and prating."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> But all this must not be
looked upon merely as an indictment against talkativeness, but an
attempt to cure it: for we overcome the passions by judgement and
practice, but judgement is the first step. For no one is wont to
shun, and eradicate from his soul, what he does not dislike. And we
dislike the passions only when we discern by reason the harm and
shame that results to us by indulging them. As we see every day in
the case of talkative people: if they wish to be loved, they are
hated; if they desire to please, they bore; when they think they
are admired, they are really laughed at; they spend, and get no
gain from so <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id=
"Page_230">230</a></span> doing; they injure their friends, benefit
their enemies, and ruin themselves. So that the first cure and
remedy of this disorder will be to reckon up the shame and trouble
that results from it.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvii.</span> In the next place we
must consider the opposite virtue to talkativeness, always
listening to and having on our lips the encomiums passed upon
reserve, and remembering the decorum sanctity and mysterious power
of silence, and ever bearing in mind that terse and brief speakers,
who put the maximum of matter into the minimum of words, are more
admired and esteemed and thought wiser<a name="FNanchor_590_590"
id="FNanchor_590_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_590" class=
"fnanchor">590</a> than unbridled windbags. And so Plato<a name=
"FNanchor_591_591" id="FNanchor_591_591"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_591_591" class="fnanchor">591</a> praises, and compares
to clever javelin-men, such as speak tersely, compressedly, and
concisely. And Lycurgus by using his citizens from boyhood to
silence taught them to perfection their brevity and terseness. For
as the Celtiberians make steel of iron only after digging down deep
in the soil, and carefully separating the iron ore, so Laconian
oratory has no rind,<a name="FNanchor_592_592" id=
"FNanchor_592_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_592" class=
"fnanchor">592</a> but by the removal of all superfluous matter
goes home straight to the point like steel. For its
sententiousness,<a name="FNanchor_593_593" id=
"FNanchor_593_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_593" class=
"fnanchor">593</a> and pointed suppleness in repartee, comes from
the habit of silence. And we ought to quote such pointed sayings
especially to talkative people, such neatness and vigour have they,
as, for example, what the Laced&aelig;monians said to Philip,
"[Remember] Dionysius at Corinth."<a name="FNanchor_594_594" id=
"FNanchor_594_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_594" class=
"fnanchor">594</a> And again, when Philip wrote to them, "If I
invade Laconia, I will drive you all out of house and home," they
only wrote back, "If." And when king Demetrius was indignant and
cried out, "The Laced&aelig;monians have only sent me one
ambassador," the ambassador was not frightened but said, "Yes, one
to one man." Certainly among the ancients men of few words were
admired. So the Amphictyones did not write extracts from the Iliad
or Odyssey, or the P&aelig;ans of <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>Pindar, in the temple of
Pythian Apollo at Delphi, but "Know thyself," "Not too much of
anything,"<a name="FNanchor_595_595" id="FNanchor_595_595"></a><a
href="#Footnote_595_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> and "Be a surety,
trouble is near;"<a name="FNanchor_596_596" id=
"FNanchor_596_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_596" class=
"fnanchor">596</a> so much did they admire compactness and
simplicity of speech, combining brevity with shrewdness of mind.
And is not the god himself short and concise in his oracles? Is he
not called Loxias,<a name="FNanchor_597_597" id=
"FNanchor_597_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_597" class=
"fnanchor">597</a> because he prefers ambiguity to longwindedness?
And are not those who express their meaning by signs without words
wonderfully praised and admired? As Heraclitus, when some of the
citizens asked him to give them his opinion about concord, got on
the platform, and took a cup of cold water, and put some
barley-meal in it, and stirred it up with penny-royal, thus showing
them that it is being content with anything, and not needing costly
dainties, that keeps cities in peace and concord. Scilurus, the
king of the Scythians, left eighty sons, and on his death-bed asked
for a bundle of sticks, and bade his sons break it when it was tied
together, and when they could not, he took the sticks one by one
and easily broke them all up: thus showing them that their harmony
and concord would make them strong and hard to overthrow, while
dissension would make them feeble and insecure.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xviii.</span> If then anyone were
continually to recollect and repeat these or similar terse sayings,
he would probably cease to be pleased with idle talk. As for
myself, when I consider of what importance it is to attend to
reason, and to keep to one's purpose, I confess I am quite put out
of countenance by the example of the slave of Pupius Piso the
orator. He, not wishing to be annoyed by their prating, ordered his
slaves merely to answer his questions, and not say a word more. On
one occasion wishing to pay honour to Clodius who was then in
power, he ordered him to be invited to his house, and provided for
him no doubt a sumptuous entertainment. At the time fixed all the
guests were present except Clodius, for whom they waited, and the
host frequently sent the slave who used to invite guests to see if
he was coming, but when evening came, and he was now quite
despaired of, he said to his slave, "Did you <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>not invite
him?" "Certainly," said the slave. "Why then has he not come?" said
the master. "Because he declined," said the slave. "Why then did
you not tell me of it at once?" said the master. "Because you never
asked me," said the slave. This was a Roman slave. But an Athenian
slave "while digging will tell his master on what terms peace was
made." So great is the force of habit in all matters. And of it we
will now speak.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xix.</span> For it is not by applying
bit or bridle that we can restrain the talkative person, we must
master the disease by habit. In the first place then, when you are
in company and questions are going round, accustom yourself not to
speak till all the rest have declined giving an answer. For as
Sophocles says, "counsel is not like a race;" no more are question
and answer. For in a race the victory belongs to him who gets in
first, but in company, if anyone has given a satisfactory answer,
it is sufficient by assenting and agreeing to his view to get the
reputation of being a pleasant fellow; and if no satisfactory
answer is given, then to enlighten ignorance and supply the
necessary information is well-timed and does not excite envy. But
let us be especially on our guard that, if anyone else is asked a
question, we do not ourselves anticipate and intercept him in
giving an answer. It is indeed perhaps nowhere good form, if
another is asked a favour, to push him aside and undertake to grant
it ourselves; for we shall seem so to upbraid two people at once,
the one who was asked as not able to grant the favour, and the
other as not knowing how to ask in the right quarter. But
especially insulting is such forwardness and impetuosity in
answering questions. For he that anticipates by his own answer the
person that was asked the question seems to say, "What is the good
of asking him? What does he know about it? In my presence nobody
else ought to be asked about these matters." And yet we often put
questions to people, not so much because we want an answer, as to
elicit from them conversation and friendly feeling, and from a wish
to fit them for company, as Socrates drew out The&aelig;tetus and
Charmides. For it is all one to run up and kiss one who wishes to
be kissed by another, or to divert to oneself the attention that he
was bestowing on another, as to intercept another person's<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
answers, and to transfer people's ears, and force their attention,
and fix them on oneself; when, even if he that was asked declines
to give an answer, it will be well to hold oneself in reserve, and
only to meet the question modestly when one's turn comes, so
framing one's answer as to seem to oblige the person who asked the
question, and as if one had been appealed to for an answer by the
other. For if people are asked questions and cannot give a
satisfactory answer they are with justice excused; but he who
without being asked undertakes to answer a question, and
anticipates another, is disagreeable even if he succeeds, while, if
his answer is unsatisfactory, he is ridiculed by all the company,
and his failure is a source of the liveliest satisfaction to
them.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xx.</span> The next thing to practise
oneself to in answering the questions put to one,&mdash;a point to
which the talkative person ought to pay the greatest
attention,&mdash;is not through inadvertence to give serious
answers to people who only challenge you to talk in fun and sport.
For some people concoct questions not for real information, but
simply for amusement and to pass the time away, and propound them
to talkative people, just to have them on. Against this we must be
on our guard, and not rush into conversation too hastily, or as if
we were obliged for the chance, but we must consider the character
of the inquirer and his purpose. When it seems that he really
desires information, we should accustom ourselves to pause, and
interpose some interval between the question and answer; during
which time the questioner can add anything if he chooses, and the
other can reflect on his answer, and not be in too great a hurry
about it, nor bury it in obscurity, nor, as is frequently the case
in too great haste, answer some other question than that which was
asked. The Pythian Priestess indeed was accustomed to utter some of
her oracles at the very moment before the question was put: for the
god whom she serves "understands the dumb, and hears the mute."<a
name="FNanchor_598_598" id="FNanchor_598_598"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_598_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> But he that wishes to
give an appropriate answer must carefully consider both the
question and the mind of the questioner, lest it be as the proverb
expresses it,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id=

</div>

<p>Besides we ought to check this greediness and hunger for words,
that it may not seem as if we had a flood on our tongue which was
dammed up, but which we were only too glad to discharge<a name=
"FNanchor_600_600" id="FNanchor_600_600"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_600_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> on a question being
put. Socrates indeed so repressed his thirst, that he would not
allow himself to drink after exercise in the gymnasium, till he had
first drawn from the well one bucket of water and poured it on to
the ground, that he might accustom his irrational part to wait upon
reason.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxi.</span> There are moreover three
kinds of answers to questions, the necessary, the polite, and the
superfluous. For instance, if anyone asked, "Is Socrates at home?"
one, as if backward and disinclined to answer, might say, "Not at
home;" or, if he wished to speak with Laconic brevity, might cut
off "at home," and simply say "No;" as, when Philip wrote to the
Laced&aelig;monians to ask if they would receive him in their city,
they sent him back merely a large "No." But another would answer
more politely, "He is not at home, but with the bankers," and if he
wished to add a little more, "he expects to see some strangers
there." But the superfluous prater, if he has read Antimachus of
Colophon,<a name="FNanchor_601_601" id="FNanchor_601_601"></a><a
href="#Footnote_601_601" class="fnanchor">601</a> says, "He is not
at home, but with the bankers, waiting for some Ionian strangers,
about whom he has had a letter from Alcibiades who is in the
neighbourhood of Miletus, staying with Tissaphernes the satrap of
the great king, who used long ago to favour the Laced&aelig;monian
party, but now attaches himself to the Athenians for Alcibiades'
sake, for Alcibiades desires to return to his country, and so has
succeeded in changing the views of Tissaphernes." And then he will
go over the whole of the Eighth Book of Thucydides, and deluge the
man, till before he is aware Miletus is captured, and Alcibiades is
in exile the second time. In such a case most of all ought we to
curtail talkativeness, by following <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>the track of a question
closely, and tracing out our answer according to the need of the
questioner with the same accuracy as we describe a circle. When
Carneades was disputing in the gymnasium before the days of his
great fame, the superintendent of the gymnasium sent to him a
message to bid him modulate his voice (for it was of the loudest),
and when he asked him to fix a standard, the superintendent replied
not amiss, "The standard of the person talking with you." So the
meaning of the questioner ought to be the standard for the
answer.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxii.</span> Moreover as Socrates
urged his disciples to abstain from such food as tempted them to
eat when they were not hungry, and from such drinks as tempted them
to drink when they were not thirsty, so the talkative person ought
to be afraid most of such subjects of conversation as he most
delights in and repeats <i>ad nauseam</i>, and to try and resist
their influence. For example, soldiers are fond of descriptions
about war, and thus Homer introduces Nestor frequently narrating
his prowess and glorious deeds. And generally speaking those who
have been successful in the law courts, or beyond their hopes been
favourites of kings and princes, are possessed, as it were by some
disease, with the itch for frequently recalling and narrating, how
they got on and were advanced, what struggles they underwent, how
they argued on some famous occasion, how they won the day either as
plaintiffs or defendants, what panegyrics were showered upon them.
For joy is much more inclined to prate than the well-known
sleeplessness represented in comedies, frequently rousing itself,
and finding something fresh to relate. And so at any excuse they
slip into such narratives. For not only,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Where anyone does itch, there
goes his hand,"<a name="FNanchor_602_602" id=
"FNanchor_602_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_602" class=

</div>

<p>but also delight has a voice of its own, and leads about the
tongue in its train, ever wishing to fortify it with memory. Thus
lovers spend most of their time in conversations that revive the
memory of their loves; and if they cannot talk to human beings
about them, they talk about them to inanimate objects, as, "O
dearest bed," and,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id=

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"O happy lamp, Bacchis deems
you a god,</span> <span class="i0">And if she thinks so, then you
are indeed</span> <span class="i0">The greatest of the
gods."</span></div>
</div>

<p>The talkative person therefore is merely as regards words a
white line,<a name="FNanchor_603_603" id="FNanchor_603_603"></a><a
href="#Footnote_603_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> but he that is
especially inclined to certain subjects should be especially on his
guard against talking about them, and should avoid such topics,
since from the pleasure they give him they may entice him to be
very prolix and tedious. The same is the case with people in regard
to such subjects as they think they are more experienced in and
acquainted with than others. For such a one, being
self-appreciative and fond of fame, "spends most of the day in that
particular branch of study in which he chances to be proficient."<a
name="FNanchor_604_604" id="FNanchor_604_604"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_604_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> Thus he that is fond
of reading will give his time to research; the grammarian his to
syntax; and the traveller, who has wandered over many countries,
his to geography. We must therefore be on our guard against our
favourite topics, for they are an enticement to talkativeness, as
its wonted haunts are to an animal. Admirable therefore was the
behaviour of Cyrus in challenging his companions, not to those
contests in which he was superior to them, but to those in which he
was inferior, partly that he might not give them pain through his
superiority, partly for his own benefit by learning from them. But
the talkative person acts just contrary, for if any subject is
introduced from which he might learn something he did not know,
this he rejects and refuses, not being able to earn a good deal by
a short silence,<a name="FNanchor_605_605" id=
"FNanchor_605_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_605" class=
"fnanchor">605</a> but he rambles round the subject and babbles out
stale and commonplace rhapsodies. As one amongst us, who by chance
had read two or three of the books of Ephorus,<a name=
"FNanchor_606_606" id="FNanchor_606_606"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_606_606" class="fnanchor">606</a> bored everybody, and
dispersed every social party, by always narrating the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id=
"Page_237">237</a></span>particulars of the battle of Leuctra and
its consequences, so that he got nicknamed Epaminondas.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxiii.</span> Nevertheless this is
one of the least of the evils of talkativeness, and we ought even
to try and divert it into such channels as these, for prating is
less of a nuisance when it is on some literary subject. We ought
also to try and get some persons to write on some topic, and so
discuss it by themselves. For Antipater the Stoic philosopher,<a
name="FNanchor_607_607" id="FNanchor_607_607"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_607_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> not being able or
willing it seems to dispute with Carneades, who inveighed
vehemently against the Stoic philosophy, writing and filling many
books of controversy against him, got the nickname of
<i>Noisy-with-the-pen</i>; and perhaps the exercise and excitement
of writing, keeping him very much apart from the community, might
make the talkative man by degrees better company to those he
associated with; as dogs, bestowing their rage on sticks and
stones, are less savage to men. It will also be very advantageous
for such to mix with people better and older than themselves, for
they will accustom themselves to be silent by standing in awe of
their reputation. And withal it will be well, when we are going to
say something, and the words are on our lips, to reflect and
consider, "What is this word that is so eager for utterance? To
what is this tongue marching? What good will come of speaking now,
or what harm of silence?" For we ought not to drop words as we
should a burden that pressed upon us, for the word remains still
after it has been spoken just the same; but men speak either on
their own behalf if they want something, or to benefit those that
hear them, or, to gratify one another, they season everyday life
with speech, as one seasons food with salt. But if words are
neither useful to the speaker, nor necessary for the hearer, nor
contain any pleasure or charm, why are they spoken? For words may
be idle and useless as well as deeds. And besides all this we must
ever remember as most important the dictum of Simonides, that he
had often repented he had spoken, but never that he had been
silent: while as to the power and strength of practice consider how
men by much toil and painstaking will get rid even of a cough or
hiccough. And silence is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238"
id="Page_238">238</a></span>not only never thirsty, as Hippocrates
says, but also never brings pain or sorrow.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> If a house is dark, or has
little air, is in an exposed position, or unhealthy, the best thing
will probably be to leave it; but if one is attached to it from
long residence in it, one can improve it and make it more light and
airy and healthy by altering the position of the windows and
stairs, and by throwing open new doors and shutting up old ones. So
some towns have been altered for the better, as my native place,<a
name="FNanchor_609_609" id="FNanchor_609_609"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_609_609" class="fnanchor">609</a> which did lie to the
west and received the rays of the setting sun from Parnassus, was
they say turned to the east by Ch&aelig;ron. And Empedocles the
naturalist is supposed to have driven away the pestilence from that
district, by having closed up a mountain gorge that was prejudicial
to health by admitting the south wind to the plains. Similarly, as
there are certain diseases of the soul that are injurious and
harmful and bring storm and darkness to it, the best thing will be
to eject them and lay them low by giving them open sky, pure air
and light, or, if that cannot be, to change and improve them some
way or other. One such mental disease, that immediately suggests
itself to one, is curiosity, the desire to know other people's
troubles, a disease that seems neither free from envy nor
malignity.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Malignant wretch, why art so
keen to mark</span> <span class="i0">Thy neighbour's fault, and
seest not thine own?"<a name="FNanchor_610_610" id=

<p>Shift your view, and turn your curiosity so as to look inwards:
if you delight to study the history of evils, you have copious
material at home, "as much as there is water in the Alizon, or
leaves on the oak," such a quantity of faults will you find in your
own life, and passions in your soul, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>and shortcomings in your
duty. For as Xenophon says<a name="FNanchor_611_611" id=
"FNanchor_611_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_611" class=
"fnanchor">611</a> good managers have one place for the vessels
they use in sacrificing, and another for those they use at meals,
one place for their farm instruments, and another for their weapons
of war, so your faults arise from different causes, some from envy,
some from jealousy, some from cowardice, some from meanness. Review
these, consider these; bar up the curiosity that pries into your
neighbours' windows and passages, and open it on the men's
apartments, and women's apartments, and servant's attics, in your
own house. There this inquisitiveness and curiosity will find full
vent, in inquiries that will not be useless or malicious, but
advantageous and serviceable, each one saying to himself,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"What have I done amiss? What
have I done?</span> <span class="i0">What that I ought to have done
left undone?"</span></div>
</div>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> And now, as they say of
Lamia that she is blind when she sleeps at home, for she puts her
eyes on her dressing-table, but when she goes out she puts her eyes
on again, and has good sight, so each of us turns, like an eye, our
malicious curiosity out of doors and on others, while we are
frequently blind and ignorant about our own faults and vices, not
applying to them our eyes and light. So that the curious man is
more use to his enemies than to himself, for he finds fault with
and exposes their shortcomings, and shows them what they ought to
avoid and correct, while he neglects most of his affairs at home,
owing to his excitement about things abroad. Odysseus indeed would
not converse with his mother till he had learnt from the seer
Tiresias what he went to Hades to learn; and after receiving that
information, then he turned to her, and asked questions about the
other women, who Tyro was, and who the fair Chloris, and why
Epicaste<a name="FNanchor_612_612" id="FNanchor_612_612"></a><a
href="#Footnote_612_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> had died, "having
fastened a noose with a long drop to the lofty beam."<a name=
"FNanchor_613_613" id="FNanchor_613_613"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_613_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> But we, while very
remiss and ignorant and careless about ourselves, know all about
the pedigrees <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id=
"Page_240">240</a></span>of other people, that our neighbour's
grandfather was a Syrian, and his grandmother a Thracian woman, and
that such a one owes three talents, and has not paid the interest.
We even inquire into such trifling matters as where somebody's wife
has been, and what those two are talking in the corner about. But
Socrates used to busy himself in examining the secret of
Pythagoras' persuasive oratory, and Aristippus, meeting Ischomachus
at the Olympian games, asked him how Socrates conversed so as to
have so much influence over the young men, and having received from
him a few scraps and samples of his style, was so enthusiastic
about it that he wasted away, and became quite pale and lean,
thirsty and parched, till he sailed to Athens and drew from the
fountain-head, and knew the wonderful man himself and his speeches
and philosophy, the object of which was that men should recognize
their faults and so get rid of them.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> But some men cannot bear
to look upon their own life, so unlovely a spectacle is it, nor to
throw and flash on themselves, like a lantern, the reflection of
reason; but their soul being burdened with all manner of vices, and
dreading and shuddering at its own interior, sallies forth and
wanders abroad, feeding and fattening its malignity there. For as a
hen, when its food stands near its coop,<a name="FNanchor_614_614"
id="FNanchor_614_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_614" class=
"fnanchor">614</a> will frequently slip off into a corner and
scratch up,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Where I ween some poor little
grain appears on the dunghill,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>so curious people neglecting conversation or inquiry about
common matters, such as no one would try and prevent or be
indignant at their prying into, pick out the secret and hidden
troubles of every family. And yet that was a witty answer of the
Egyptian, to the person who asked him, "What he was carrying
wrapped up;" "It was wrapped up on purpose that you should not
know." And you too, Sir, I would say to a curious person, why do
you pry into what is hidden? If it were not something bad it would
not be hidden. Indeed it is not usual to go into a strange house
without knocking at the door, and nowadays there are porters, but
in old times there were knockers on doors <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>to let the people
inside know when anyone called, that a stranger might not find the
mistress or daughter of the house <i>en d&eacute;shabille</i>, or
one of the slaves being corrected, or the maids bawling out. But
the curious person intrudes on all such occasions as these,
although he would be unwilling to be a spectator, even if invited,
of a well-ordered family: but the things for which bars and bolts
and doors are required, these he reveals and divulges openly to
others. Those are the most troublesome winds, as Aristo says, that
blow up our clothes: but the curious person not only strips off the
garments and clothes of his neighbours, but breaks through their
walls, opens their doors, and like the wanton wind, that insinuates
itself into maidenly reserve, he pries into and calumniates dances
and routs and revels.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> And as Cleon is satirized
in the play<a name="FNanchor_615_615" id="FNanchor_615_615"></a><a
href="#Footnote_615_615" class="fnanchor">615</a> as having "his
hands among the &AElig;tolians, but his soul in Peculation-town,"
so the soul of the curious man is at once in the mansions of the
rich, and the cottages of the poor, and the courts of kings, and
the bridal chambers of the newly married; he pries into everything,
the affairs of foreigners, the affairs of princes, and sometimes
not without danger. For just as if one were to taste aconite to
investigate its properties, and kill oneself before one had
discovered them, so those that pry into the troubles of great
people ruin themselves before they get the knowledge they desire;
even as those become blind who, neglecting the wide and general
diffusion all over the earth of the sun's rays, impudently attempt
to gaze at its orb and penetrate to its light. And so that was a
wise answer of Philippides the Comic Poet, when King Lysimachus
asked him on one occasion, "What would you like to have of mine?"
"Anything, O king, but your secrets." For the pleasantest and
finest things to be got from kings are public, as banquets, and
riches, and festivities, and favours: but come not near any secret
of theirs, pry not into it. There is no concealment of the joy of a
prosperous monarch, or of his laugh when he is in a playful mood,
or of any tokens of his goodwill and favour; but dreadful is what
he conceals, his gloominess, his sternness, his reserve, his store
of latent wrath, his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id=
"Page_242">242</a></span>meditation on stern revenge, his jealousy
of his wife, or suspicion of his son, or doubt about the fidelity
of a friend. Flee from this cloud that is so black and threatening,
for when its hidden fury bursts forth, you will not fail to hear
its thunder and see its lightning.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> How shall you flee from it?
Why, by dissipating and distracting your curiosity, by turning your
soul to better and pleasanter objects: examine the phenomena of
sky, and earth, and air, and sea. Are you by nature fond of gazing
at little or great things? If at great, turn your attention to the
sun, consider its rising and setting: view the changes of the moon,
like the changes of our mortal life, see how it waxes and
wanes,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"How at the first it peers out
small and dim</span> <span class="i0">Till it unfolds its full and
glorious Orb,</span> <span class="i0">And when its zenith it has
once attained,</span> <span class="i0">Again it wanes, grows small,
and disappears."<a name="FNanchor_616_616" id=
"FNanchor_616_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_616" class=
"fnanchor">616</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>These are indeed Nature's secrets, but they bring no trouble on
those that study them. But if you decline the study of great
things, inspect with curiosity smaller matters, see how some plants
flourish, are green and gay, and exhibit their beauty, all the year
round, while others are sometimes gay like them, at other times,
like some unthrift, run through their resources entirely, and are
left bare and naked. Consider again their various shapes, how some
produce oblong fruits, others angular, others smooth and round. But
perhaps you will not care to pry into all this, since you will find
nothing bad. If you must then ever bestow your time and attention
on what is bad, as the serpent lives but in deadly matter, go to
history, and turn your eye on the sum total of human misery. For
there you will find "the falls of men, and murders of their
lives,"<a name="FNanchor_617_617" id="FNanchor_617_617"></a><a
href="#Footnote_617_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> rapes of women,
attacks of slaves, treachery of friends, mixing of poisons,
envyings, jealousies, "shipwrecks of families," and dethroning of
princes. Sate and cloy your<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243"
id="Page_243">243</a></span>self on these, you will by so doing vex
and enrage none of your associates.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> But it seems curiosity
does not rejoice in stale evils, but only in fresh and recent ones,
gladly viewing the spectacle of tragedies of yesterday, but
backward in taking part in comic and festive scenes. And so the
curious person is a languid and listless hearer to the narrator of
a marriage, or sacrifice, or solemn procession, he says he has
heard most of all that before, bids the narrator cut it short and
come to the point; but if his visitor tell him of the violation of
some girl, or the adultery of some married woman, or the disputes
and intended litigation of brothers, he doesn't go to sleep then,
nor pretend want of leisure,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"But he pricks up his ears,
and asks for more."</span></div>
</div>

<p>And indeed those lines,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Alas! how quicker far to
mortals' ears</span> <span class="i0">Do ill news travel than the
news of good!"</span></div>
</div>

<p>are truly said of curious people. For as cupping-glasses take
away the worst blood, so the ears of curious people attract only
the worst reports; or rather, as cities have certain ominous and
gloomy gates, through which they conduct only condemned criminals,
or convey filth and night soil, for nothing pure or holy has either
ingress into or egress from them, so into the ears of curious
people goes nothing good or elegant, but tales of murders travel
and lodge there, wafting a whiff of unholy and obscene
narrations.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"And ever in my house is heard
alone</span> <span class="i0">The sound of wailing;"</span></div>
</div>

<p>this is to the curious their one Muse and Siren, this the
sweetest note they can hear. For curiosity desires to know what is
hidden and secret; but no one conceals his good fortune, nay
sometimes people even pretend to have such advantages as they do
not really possess. So the curious man, eager to hear a history of
what is bad, is possessed by the passion of malignity, which is
brother to envy and jealousy. For envy is pain at another's
blessings, and malignity is joy at another's misfortunes: and both
proceed from the same savage and brutish vice, ill-nature.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id=
"Page_244">244</a></span>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> But
so unpleasant is it to everybody to have his private ills brought
to light, that many have died rather than acquaint the doctors with
their secret ailments. For suppose Herophilus, or Erasistratus, or
even &AElig;sculapius himself during his sojourn on earth, had gone
with their drugs and surgical instruments from house to house, to
inquire what man had a fistula in ano, or what woman had a cancer
in her womb;&mdash;and yet their curiosity would have been
professional<a name="FNanchor_618_618" id="FNanchor_618_618"></a><a
href="#Footnote_618_618" class="fnanchor">618</a>&mdash;who would
not have driven them away from their house, for not waiting till
they were sent for, and for coming without being asked to spy out
their neighbours' ailments? But curious people pry into these and
even worse matters, not from a desire to heal them, but only to
expose them to others, which makes them deservedly hated. For we
are not vexed and mortified with custom-house officers when they
levy toll on goods <i>bona fide</i> imported, but only when they
seek for contraband articles, and rip up bags and packages: and yet
the law allows them to do even this, and sometimes it is injurious
to them not to do so. But curious people abandon and neglect their
own affairs, and are busy about their neighbours' concerns. Seldom
do they go into the country, for they do not care for its quiet and
stillness and solitude, but if once in a way they do go there, they
look more at their neighbours' vines than their own, and inquire
how many cows of their neighbour have died, or how much of his wine
has turned sour, and when they are satisfied on these points they
soon return to town again. But the genuine countryman does not
willingly listen to any rumour that chances to come from the town,
for he quotes the following lines,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Even with spade in hand he'll
tell the terms</span> <span class="i0">On which peace was
concluded: all these things</span> <span class="i0">The
curs&egrave;d fellow walks about and pries into."</span></div>
</div>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> But curious people shun
the country as stale and dull and too quiet, and push into
warehouses and markets and harbours, asking, "Any news? Were you
not in the market in the forenoon?" and sometimes receiving for
answer, "What then? Do you think things in the town change every
three hours?" Notwithstanding if any<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>one brings any news, he'll
get off his horse, and embrace him, and kiss him, and stand to
listen. If however the person who meets him says he has no news, he
will say somewhat peevishly, "No news, Sir? Have you not been in
the market? Did you not pass by the officers' quarters? Did you
exchange no words with those that have just arrived from Italy?" To
stop such people the Locrian authorities had an excellent rule;
they fined everyone coming from abroad who asked what the news was.
For as cooks pray for plenty of meat, and fishmongers for shoals of
fish, so curious people pray for shoals of trouble, and plenty of
business, and innovations and changes, that they may have something
to hunt after and tittle-tattle about. Well also was it in
<i>Charondas</i>, the legislator of the people of Thurii,<a name=
"FNanchor_619_619" id="FNanchor_619_619"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_619_619" class="fnanchor">619</a> to forbid any of the
citizens but adulterers and curious persons to be ridiculed on the
stage. Adultery itself indeed seems to be only the fruit of
curiosity about another man's pleasures, and an inquiring and
prying into things kept close and hidden from the world; while
curiosity is a tampering with and seduction of and revealing the
nakedness of secrets.<a name="FNanchor_620_620" id=
"FNanchor_620_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_620" class=
"fnanchor">620</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> As it is likely that much
learning will produce wordiness, and so Pythagoras enjoined five
years' silence on his scholars, calling it a truce from words,<a
name="FNanchor_621_621" id="FNanchor_621_621"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_621_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> so defamation of
character is sure to go with curiosity. For what people are glad to
hear they are glad to talk about, and what they eagerly pick up
from others they joyfully retail to others. And so, amongst the
other mischiefs of curiosity, the disease runs counter to their
desires; for all people fight shy of them, and conceal their
affairs from them, and neither care to do or say anything in their
presence, but defer consultations, and put off investigations, till
such people are out of the way; and if, when some secret is just
about to be uttered, or some important business is <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>just about
to be arranged, some curious man happen to pop in, they are mum at
once and reserved, as one puts away fish if the cat is about; and
so frequently things seen and talked about by all the rest of the
world are unknown only to them. For the same reason the curious
person never gets the confidence of anybody. For we would rather
entrust our letters and papers and seals to slaves and strangers
than to curious friends and intimates. The famous Bellerophon,<a
name="FNanchor_622_622" id="FNanchor_622_622"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_622_622" class="fnanchor">622</a> though he carried
letters against his life, opened them not, but abstained from
reading the letter to the king, as he had refused to sell his
honour to Proetus' wife, so great was his continence.<a name=
"FNanchor_623_623" id="FNanchor_623_623"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_623_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> For curiosity and
adultery both come from incontinence, and to the latter is added
monstrous folly and insanity. For to pass by so many common and
public women, and to intrude oneself on some married woman,<a name=
"FNanchor_624_624" id="FNanchor_624_624"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_624_624" class="fnanchor">624</a> who is sure to be more
costly, and possibly less pretty to boot, is the acme of madness.
Yet such is the conduct of curious people. They neglect many gay
sights, fail to hear much that would be well worth hearing, lose
much fine sport and pastime, to break open private letters, to put
their ears to their neighbour's walls, and to whisper to their
slaves and women-servants, practices always low, and frequently
dangerous.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> It will be exceedingly
useful, therefore, to deter the curious from these propensities,
for them to remember their past experience. Simonides used to say
that he occasionally opened two chests for rewards and thanks that
he had by him, and found the one full for rewards, but the one for
thanks always empty.<a name="FNanchor_625_625" id=
"FNanchor_625_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_625" class=
"fnanchor">625</a> So if anyone were to open occasionally the
stores that curiosity had amassed, and observe what a cargo there
was of useless and idle and unlovely things, perhaps the sight of
all this poor stuff would inspire him with disgust. Suppose
someone, in studying the writings of the ancients, were to pick out
only their worst passages, and compile them into a volume, <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>as
Homer's imperfect lines, and the solecisms of the tragedians, and
Archilochus' indecent and bitter railings against women, by which
he so exposed himself, would he not be worthy of the curse of the
tragedian,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Perish, compiler of thy
neighbours' ills?"</span></div>
</div>

<p>And independently of such a curse, the piling up of other
people's misdoings is indecent and useless, and like the town which
Philip founded and filled with the vilest and most dissolute
wretches, and called <i>Rogue Town</i>. Curious persons, indeed,
making a collection of the faults and errors and solecisms, not of
lines or poems but of people's lives, render their memory a most
inelegant and unlovely register of dark deeds. Just as there are in
Rome some people who care nothing for pictures and statues, or even
handsome boys or women exposed for sale, but haunt the
monster-market, and make eager inquiries about people who have no
calves, or three eyes, or arms like weasels, or heads like
ostriches, and look about for some</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Unnatural monster like the
Minotaur,"<a name="FNanchor_626_626" id="FNanchor_626_626"></a><a

</div>

<p>and for a time are greatly captivated with them, but if anyone
continually gazes at such sights, they will soon give him satiety
and disgust; so let those who curiously inquire into the errors and
faults of life, and disgraces of families, and disorders in other
people's houses, first remember what little favour or advantage
such prying has brought them on previous occasions.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xi.</span> Habit will be of the
utmost importance in stopping this propensity, if we begin early to
practise self-control in respect to it, for as the disease
increases by habit and degrees, so will its cure, as we shall see
when we discuss the necessary discipline. In the first place, let
us begin with the most trifling and unimportant matters. What
hardship will it be when we walk abroad not to read the epitaphs on
graves, or what detriment shall we suffer by not glancing at the
inscriptions on walls in the public walks? Let us reflect that
there is nothing useful or pleasant for us in these notices, which
only record that so-and-so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248"
id="Page_248">248</a></span> remembered so-and-so out of
gratitude, and, "Here lies the best of friends," and much poor
stuff of that kind;<a name="FNanchor_627_627" id=
"FNanchor_627_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_627" class=
"fnanchor">627</a> which indeed do not seem to do much harm, except
indirectly, to those that read them, by engendering the practice of
curiosity about things immaterial. And as huntsmen do not allow the
hounds to follow any scent and run where they please, but check and
restrain them in leashes, keeping their sense of smell pure and
fresh for the object of their chase, that they may the keener dart
on their tracks, "following up the traces of the unfortunate beasts
by their scent," so we must check and repress the sallies and
excursions of the curious man to every object of interest, whether
of sight or hearing, and confine him to what is useful. For as
eagles and lions on the prowl keep their claws sheathed that they
may not lose their edge and sharpness, so, when we remember that
curiosity for learning has also its edge and keenness, let us not
entirely expend or blunt it on inferior objects.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xii.</span> Next let us accustom
ourselves when we pass a strange house not to look inside at the
door, or curiously inspect the interior, as if we were going to
pilfer something, remembering always that saying of Xenocrates,
that it is all one whether one puts one's feet or eyes in another
person's house. For such prying is neither honourable, nor comely,
nor even agreeable.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Stranger, thou'lt see within
untoward sights."</span></div>
</div>

<p>For such is generally the condition inside houses, utensils
kicking about, maids lolling about, no work going on, nothing to
please the eye; and moreover such side glances, and stray shots as
it were, distort the soul, and are unhandsome, and the practice is
a pernicious one. When Diogenes saw Dioxippus, a victor at Olympia,
driving up in his chariot and unable to take his eyes off a
handsome woman who was watching the procession, but still turning
round and casting sheep's eyes at her, he said, "See you yon
athlete straining his neck to look at a girl?" And similarly you
may see curious people twisting and straining <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>their
necks at every spectacle alike, from the habit and practice of
turning their eyes in all directions. And I think the senses ought
not to rove about, like an ill-trained maid, when sent on an errand
by the soul, but to do their business, and then return quickly with
the answer, and afterwards to keep within the bounds of reason, and
obey her behests. But it is like those lines of Sophocles,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Then did the &AElig;nianian's
horses bolt,</span> <span class="i0">Unmanageable quite;"<a name=
"FNanchor_628_628" id="FNanchor_628_628"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_628_628" class="fnanchor">628</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>for so the senses not having, as we said, right training and
practice, often run away, and drag reason along with them, and
plunge her into unlawful excesses. And so, though that story about
Democritus is false, that he purposely destroyed his eyesight by
the reflection from burning-glasses (as people sometimes shut up
windows that look into the street), that they might not disturb him
by frequently calling off his attention to external things, but
allow him to confine himself to purely intellectual matters, yet it
is very true in every case that those who use the mind most are
least acted upon by the senses. And so the philosophers erected
their places for study as far as possible from towns, and called
Night the time propitious to thought,<a name="FNanchor_629_629" id=
"FNanchor_629_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_629" class=
"fnanchor">629</a> thinking quiet and withdrawal from worldly
distractions a great help towards meditating upon and solving the
problems of life.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> Moreover, when men are
abusing and reviling one another in the market-place, it is not
very difficult or tiresome not to go near them; or if a tumultuous
concourse of people crowd together, to remain seated; or to get up
and go away, if you are not master of yourself. For you will gain
no advantage by mixing yourself up with curious people: but you
will derive the greatest benefit from putting a force upon your
inclinations, and bridling your curiosity, and accustoming it to
obey reason. Afterwards it will be well to extend the practice
still further, and not to go to the theatre when some fine piece is
performing, and if your friends invite you to see some dancer or
actor to decline, and, if there is some shouting <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>in the
stadium and hippodrome, not even to turn your head to look what is
up. For as Socrates advised people to abstain from food that made
them eat when they were not hungry, and from drinks that made them
drink when they were not thirsty, so ought we also to shun and flee
from those objects of interest, whether to eye or ear, that master
us and attract us when we stand in no need of them. Thus Cyrus
would not look at Panthea, but when Araspes told him that her
beauty was well worth inspection, he replied, "For that very reason
must I the more abstain from seeing her, for if at your persuasion
I were to pay her a visit, perhaps she would persuade me to visit
her again when I could ill spare the time, so that I might neglect
important business to sit with her and gaze on her charms."<a name=
"FNanchor_630_630" id="FNanchor_630_630"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_630_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> Similarly Alexander
would not see the wife of Darius, who was reputed to be very
beautiful, but visited her mother who was old, and would not
venture to look upon the young and handsome queen. We on the
contrary peep into women's litters, and hang about their windows,
and think we do no harm, though we thus make our curiosity a
loop-hole<a name="FNanchor_631_631" id="FNanchor_631_631"></a><a
href="#Footnote_631_631" class="fnanchor">631</a> for all manner of
vice.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> Moreover, as it is of
great help to fair dealing sometimes not to seize some honest gain,
that you may accustom yourself as far as possible to flee from
unjust gains, and as it makes greatly for virtue to abstain
sometimes from your own wife, that you may not ever be tempted by
another woman, so, applying the habit to curiosity, try not to see
and hear at times all that goes on in your own house even, and if
anyone wishes to tell you anything about it give him the go-by, and
decline to hear him. For it was nothing but his curiosity that
involved &OElig;dipus in his extreme calamities: for it was to try
and find out his extraction that he left Corinth and met Laius, and
killed him, and got his kingdom, and married his own mother, and
when he then seemed at the acme of felicity, he must needs make
further inquiries about himself; and though his wife tried to
prevent him, he none the less com<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>pelled the old man that had
been an eye-witness of the deed to tell him all the circumstances
of it, and though he long suspected how the story would end, yet
when the old man cried out,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Alas! the dreadful tale I
must then tell,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>so inflamed was he with curiosity and trembling with impatience,
that he replied,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I too must hear, for hear it
now I will."<a name="FNanchor_632_632" id="FNanchor_632_632"></a><a
href="#Footnote_632_632" class="fnanchor">632</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>So bitter-sweet and uncontrollable is the itch of curiosity,
like a sore, shedding its blood when lanced. But he that is free
from this disease, and calm by nature, being ignorant of many
unpleasant things, may say,</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> We ought therefore also to
accustom ourselves, when we receive a letter, not to be in a
tremendous hurry about breaking the seal, as most people are, even
tearing it open with their teeth if their hands are slow; nor to
rise from our seat and run up to meet him, if a messenger comes;
and if a friend says, "I have some news to tell you," we ought to
say, "I had rather you had something useful or advantageous to tell
me." When I was on one occasion lecturing at Rome, one of my
audience was the well-known Rusticus, whom the Emperor Domitian
afterwards had put to death through envy of his glory, and a
soldier came in in the middle and brought him a letter from the
Emperor, and silence ensuing, and I stopping that he might have
time to read his letter, he would not, and did not open it till I
had finished my lecture, and the audience had dispersed; so that
everybody marvelled at his self-control. But whenever anyone who
has power feeds his curiosity till it is strong and vehement, he
can no longer easily control it, when it hurries him on to illicit
acts, from force of habit; and such people open their friends'
letters, thrust themselves in at private meetings, become
spectators of rites <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id=
"Page_252">252</a></span>they ought not to witness, enter holy
grounds they ought not to, and pry into the lives and conversations
of kings.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> Indeed tyrants
themselves, who must know all things, are made unpopular by no
class more than by their spies<a name="FNanchor_634_634" id=
"FNanchor_634_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_634" class=
"fnanchor">634</a> and talebearers. Darius in his youth, when he
mistrusted his own powers, and suspected and feared everybody, was
the first who employed spies; and the Dionysiuses introduced them
at Syracuse: but in a revolution they were the first that the
Syracusans took and tortured to death. Indeed informers are of the
same tribe and family as curious people. However informers only
investigate wicked acts or plots, but curious people pry into and
publish abroad the involuntary misfortunes of their neighbours. And
it is said that impious people first got their name from curiosity,
for it seems there was a mighty famine at Athens, and those people
that had wheat not producing it, but grinding it stealthily by
night in their houses, some of their neighbours went about and
noticed the noise of the mills grinding, and so they got their
name.<a name="FNanchor_635_635" id="FNanchor_635_635"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_635_635" class="fnanchor">635</a> This also is the
origin of the well-known Greek word for informer, (Sycophant,
<i>quasi</i> Fig-informer), for when the people were forbidden to
export figs, those who informed against those who did were called
Fig-informers. It is well worth the while of curious people to give
their attention to this, that they may be ashamed of having any
similarity or connection in habit with a class of people so
universally hated and disliked as informers.</p>

Plutarch makes adultery mere curiosity, and curiosity a sort of

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Some of the things that
grow on the earth are in their nature wild and barren and injurious
to the growth <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id=
"Page_253">253</a></span>of seeds and plants, yet those who till
the ground consider them indications not of a bad soil but of a
rich and fat one;<a name="FNanchor_637_637" id=
"FNanchor_637_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_637" class=
"fnanchor">637</a> so also there are passions of the soul that are
not good, yet are as it were offshoots of a good disposition, and
one likely to improve with good advice. Among these I class
shyness, no bad sign in itself, though it affords occasion to vice.
For the modest oftentimes plunge into the same excesses as the
shameless, but then they are pained and grieved at them, and not
pleased like the others. For the shameless person is quite
apathetic at what is disgraceful, while the modest person is easily
affected even at the very appearance of it. Shyness is in fact an
excess of modesty. And thus it is called shamefacedness, because
the face exhibits the changes of the mind. For as dejection is
defined to be the grief that makes people look on the ground, so
shamefacedness is that shyness that cannot look people in the face.
And so the orator said the shameless person had not pupils<a name=
"FNanchor_638_638" id="FNanchor_638_638"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_638_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> in his eyes but
harlots. The bashful person on the other hand shows his delicacy
and effeminacy of soul in his countenance, and palliates his
weakness, which exposes him to defeat at the hands of the impudent,
by the name of modesty. Cato used to say he was better pleased with
those lads that blushed than with those that turned pale, rightly
teaching us to fear censure more than labour,<a name=
"FNanchor_639_639" id="FNanchor_639_639"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_639_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> and suspicion than
danger. However we must avoid too much timidity and fear of
censure, since many have played the coward, and abandoned noble
ventures, more from fear of a bad name than of the dangers to be
undergone, not being able to bear a bad reputation.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> As we must not disregard
their weakness, so neither again must we praise that rigid and
stubborn insensibility, "that recklessness and frantic energy to
rush anywhere, that seemed like a dog's courage in Anaxarchus."<a
name="FNanchor_640_640" id="FNanchor_640_640"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_640_640" class="fnanchor">640</a> But we must contrive a
harmonious blending of the two, that shall remove the shamelessness
of pertinacity, and the weakness of excessive modesty; seeing its
cure is</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id=
"Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>difficult, and the correction of such excesses not without
danger. For as the husbandman, in rooting up some wild and useless
weed, at once plunges his spade vigorously into the ground, and
digs it up by the root, or burns it with fire, but if he has to do
with a vine that needs pruning, or some apple-tree, or olive, he
puts his hand to it very carefully, being afraid of injuring any
sound part; so the philosopher, eradicating from the soul of the
young man that ignoble and untractable weed, envy, or unseasonable
avarice, or amputating the excessive love of pleasure, may bandage
and draw blood, make deep incision, and leave scars: but if he has
to apply reason as a corrective to a tender and delicate part of
the soul, such as shyness and bashfulness, he is careful that he
may not inadvertently root up modesty as well. For nurses who are
often rubbing the dirt off their infants sometimes tear their flesh
and put them to torture. We ought not therefore, by rubbing off the
shyness of youths too much, to make them too careless and
contemptuous; but as those that pull down houses close to temples
prop up the adjacent parts, so in trying to get rid of shyness we
must not eradicate with it the virtues akin to it, as modesty and
meekness and mildness, by which it insinuates itself and becomes
part of a man's character, flattering the bashful man that he has a
nature courteous and civil and affable, and not hard as flint or
self-willed. And so the Stoics from the outset verbally
distinguished shame and shyness from modesty, that they might not
by identity of name give the vice opportunity to inflict harm. But
let it be granted to us to use the words indiscriminately,
following indeed the example of Homer. For he said,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Modesty does both harm and
good to men;"<a name="FNanchor_641_641" id=
"FNanchor_641_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_641" class=
"fnanchor">641</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>and he did well to mention the harm it does first. For it
becomes advantageous only through reason's curtailing its excess,
and reducing it to moderate proportions.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> In the first place, then,
the person who is afflicted with shyness ought to be persuaded that
he suffers from an injurious disease, and that nothing injurious
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id=
"Page_255">255</a></span> can be good: nor must he be wheedled and
tickled with the praise of being called a nice and jolly fellow
rather than being styled lofty and dignified and just; nor, like
Pegasus in Euripides, "who stooped and crouched lower than he
wished"<a name="FNanchor_642_642" id="FNanchor_642_642"></a><a
href="#Footnote_642_642" class="fnanchor">642</a> to take up his
rider Bellerophon, must he humble himself and grant whatever
favours are asked him, fearing to be called hard and ungentle. They
say that the Egyptian Bocchoris, who was by nature very severe, had
an asp sent him by Isis, which coiled round his head, and shaded
him from above, that he might judge righteously. Bashfulness on the
contrary, like a dead weight on languid and effeminate persons, not
daring to refuse or contradict anybody, makes jurors deliver unjust
verdicts, and shuts the mouth of counsellors, and makes people say
and do many things against their wish; and so the most headstrong
person is always master and lord of such, through his own impudence
prevailing against their modesty. So bashfulness, like soft and
sloping ground, being unable to repel or avert any attack, lies
open to the most shameful acts and passions. It is a bad guardian
of youth, as Brutus said he didn't think that person had spent his
youth well who had not learnt how to say No. It is a bad duenna of
the bridal bed and of women's apartments, as the penitent adultress
in Sophocles said to her seducer,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"You did persuade, and coax me
into sin."<a name="FNanchor_643_643" id="FNanchor_643_643"></a><a
href="#Footnote_643_643" class="fnanchor">643</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Thus shyness, being first seduced by vice,<a name=
"FNanchor_644_644" id="FNanchor_644_644"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_644_644" class="fnanchor">644</a> leaves its citadel
unbarred, unfortified, and open to attack. By gifts people ensnare
the worse natures, but by persuasion and playing upon their
bashfulness people often seduce even good women. I pass over the
injury done to worldly affairs by bashfulness causing people to
lend to those whose credit is doubtful, and to go security against
their wish, for though they commend that saying, "Be a surety,
trouble is at hand,"<a name="FNanchor_645_645" id=
"FNanchor_645_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_645" class=
"fnanchor">645</a> they cannot apply it when business is on
hand.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> It would not be easy to
enumerate how many this vice has ruined. When Creon said to
Medea,</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id=

<div class="poem">

<p>he uttered a pregnant maxim for others; for he himself was
overcome by his bashfulness, and granted her one day more, and so
was the undoing of his family. And some, when they suspected murder
or poison, have failed through it to take precautions for their
safety. Thus perished Dion, not ignorant that Callippus was
plotting against him, but ashamed to be on his guard against a
friend and host. So Antipater, the son of Cassander, having invited
Demetrius to supper, and being invited back by him for the next
day, was ashamed to doubt another as he had been trusted himself,
and went, and got his throat cut after supper. And Polysperchon
promised Cassander for a hundred talents to murder Hercules, the
son of Alexander by Barsine, and invited him to supper, and, as the
stripling suspected and feared the invitation, and pleaded as an
excuse that he was not very well, Polysperchon called on him, and
addressed him as follows, "Imitate, my lad, your father's
good-nature and kindness to his friends, unless indeed you fear us
as plotting against you." The young man was ashamed to refuse any
longer, so he went with him, and some of those at the supper-party
strangled him. And so that line of Hesiod,<a name=
"FNanchor_647_647" id="FNanchor_647_647"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_647_647" class="fnanchor">647</a></p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Invite your friend to supper,
not your enemy,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>is not ridiculous, as some say, or stupid advice, but wise. Show
no bashfulness in regard to an enemy, and do not suppose him
trustworthy, though he may seem so.<a name="FNanchor_648_648" id=
"FNanchor_648_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_648" class=
"fnanchor">648</a> For if you invite you will be invited back, and
if you entertain others you will be entertained back to your hurt,
if you let the temper as it were of your caution be weakened by
shame.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> As then this disease is the
cause of much mischief, we must try and exterminate it by assiduous
effort, beginning first, as people are wont to do in other matters,
with small and easy things. For example, if anyone pledge you to
drink with him at a dinner when you have had enough, do not be
bashful, or do violence to nature, but <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>put the cup down
without drinking. Again, if somebody else challenge you to play at
dice with him in your cups, be not bashful or afraid of ridicule,
but imitate Xenophanes, who, when Lasus of Hermione called him
coward because he would not play at dice with him, admitted that he
was a great coward and had no courage for what was ignoble. Again,
if you meet with some prating fellow who attacks you and sticks to
you, do not be bashful, but get rid of him, and hasten on and
pursue your undertaking. For such flights and repulses, keeping you
in practice in trying to overcome your bashfulness in small
matters, will prepare you for greater occasions. And here it is
well to record a remark of Demosthenes. When the Athenians were
going to help Harpalus, and to war against Alexander, all of a
sudden Philoxenus, who was Alexander's admiral, was sighted in the
offing. And the populace being greatly alarmed, and speechless for
fear, Demosthenes said, "What will they do when they see the sun,
if they cannot lift their eyes to face a lamp?" And what will you
do in important matters, if the king desires anything, or the
people importune you, if you cannot decline to drink when your
friend asks you, or evade the onset of some prating fellow, but
allow the trifler to waste all your time, from not having nerve to
say, "I will see you some other time, I have no leisure now."<a
name="FNanchor_649_649" id="FNanchor_649_649"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_649_649" class="fnanchor">649</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> Moreover, the use and
practice of restraining one's bashfulness in small and unimportant
matters is advantageous also in regard to praise. For example, if a
friend's harper sings badly at a drinking party, or an actor hired
at great cost murders<a name="FNanchor_650_650" id=
"FNanchor_650_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_650" class=
"fnanchor">650</a> Menander, and most of the party clap and
applaud, I find it by no means hard, or bad manners, to listen
silently, and not to be so illiberal as to praise contrary to one's
convictions. For if in such matters you are not master of yourself,
what will you do if your friend reads a poor poem, or parades a
speech stupidly and ridiculously written?<a name="FNanchor_651_651"
id="FNanchor_651_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_651" class=
"fnanchor">651</a> You will praise it of course, and join the
flatterers in loud applause. But how then will you <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>find fault
with your friend if he makes mistakes in business? How will you be
able to correct him, if he acts improperly in reference to some
office, or marriage, or the state? For I cannot indeed assent to
the remark of Pericles to his friend, who asked him to bear false
witness in his favour even to the extent of perjury, "I am your
friend as far as the altar." He went too far. But he that has long
accustomed himself never to go against his convictions in praising
a speaker, or clapping a singer, or laughing at a dull buffoon,
will never go to this length, nor say to some impudent fellow in
such matters, "Swear on my behalf, bear false witness, pronounce an
unjust verdict."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> So also we ought to
refuse people that want to borrow money of us, from being
accustomed to say No in small and easily refused matters. Thus
Archelaus, king of the Macedonians, being asked at supper for a
gold cup by a man who thought <i>Receive</i> the finest word in the
language, bade a boy give it to Euripides,<a name=
"FNanchor_652_652" id="FNanchor_652_652"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_652_652" class="fnanchor">652</a> and gazing intently on
the man said to him, "You are fit to ask, and not to receive, and
he is fit to receive without asking." Thus did he make judgement
and not bashfulness the arbiter of his gifts and favours. Yet we
oftentimes pass over our friends who are both deserving and in
need, and give to others who continually and impudently importune
us, not from the wish to give but from the inability to say No. So
the older Antigonus, being frequently annoyed by Bion, said, "Give
a talent to Bion and necessity." Yet he was of all the kings most
clever and ingenious at getting rid of such importunity. For on one
occasion, when a Cynic asked him for a drachma, he replied, "That
would be too little for a king to give;"<a name="FNanchor_653_653"
id="FNanchor_653_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_653" class=
"fnanchor">653</a> and when the Cynic rejoined, "Give me then a
talent," he met him with, "That would be too much for a Cynic to
receive."<a name="FNanchor_654_654" id="FNanchor_654_654"></a><a
href="#Footnote_654_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> Diogenes indeed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id=
"Page_259">259</a></span>used to go round begging to the statues in
the Ceramicus, and when people expressed their astonishment said he
was practising how to bear refusals. And we must practise ourselves
in small matters, and exercise ourselves in little things, with a
view to refusing people who importune us, or would receive from us
when inconvenient, that we may be able to avoid great miscarriages.
For no one, as Demosthenes says,<a name="FNanchor_655_655" id=
"FNanchor_655_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_655" class=
"fnanchor">655</a> if he expends his resources on unnecessary
things, will have means for necessary ones. And our disgrace is
greatly increased, if we are deficient in what is noble, and abound
in what is trivial.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> But bashfulness is not
only a bad and inconsiderate manager of money, but also in more
important matters makes us reject expediency and reason. For when
we are ill we do not call in the experienced doctor, because we
stand in awe of the family one; and instead of the best teachers
for our boys we select those that importune us;<a name=
"FNanchor_656_656" id="FNanchor_656_656"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_656_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> and in our suits at
law we frequently refuse the aid of some skilled advocate, to
oblige the son of some friend or relative, and give him a chance to
make a forensic display; and lastly, you will find many so-called
philosophers Epicureans or Stoics, not from deliberate choice or
conviction, but simply from bashfulness, to have the same views as
their friends and acquaintances. Since this is the case, let us
accustom ourselves betimes in small and everyday matters to employ
no barber or fuller merely from bashfulness, nor to put up at a
sorry inn, when a better is at hand, merely because the innkeeper
has on several occasions been extra civil to us, but for the
benefit of the habit to select the best even in a small matter; as
the Pythagoreans were careful never to put their left leg across
the right, nor to take an even number instead of an odd, all other
matters being indifferent. We must accustom ourselves also, at a
sacrifice or marriage or any entertainment of that kind, not to
invite the person who greets us and runs up to meet us, but the
friend who is serviceable to us. For he that has thus practised and
trained himself will be difficult to catch tripping, nay even
unassailable, in greater matters.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id=
"Page_260">260</a></span>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> Let
so much suffice for practice. And of useful considerations the
first is that which teaches and reminds us, that all passions and
maladies of the soul are accompanied by the very things which we
think we avoid through them. Thus infamy comes through too great
love of fame, and pain comes from love of pleasure, and plenty of
work to the idle, and to the contentious defeats and losses of
lawsuits. And so too it is the fate of bashfulness, in fleeing from
the smoke of ill-repute, to throw itself into the fire of it.<a
name="FNanchor_657_657" id="FNanchor_657_657"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_657_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> For the bashful, not
venturing to say No to those that press them hard, afterwards feel
shame at just rebuke, and, through standing in awe of slight blame,
frequently in the end incur open disgrace. For if a friend asks
some money of them, and through bashfulness they cannot refuse, a
little time after they are disgraced by the facts becoming known;<a
name="FNanchor_658_658" id="FNanchor_658_658"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_658_658" class="fnanchor">658</a> or if they have
promised to help friends in a lawsuit, they turn round and hide
their diminished heads, and run away from fear of the other side.
Many also, who have accepted on behalf of a daughter or sister an
unprofitable offer of marriage at the bidding of bashfulness, have
afterwards been compelled to break their word, and break off the
match.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> He that said all the
dwellers in Asia were slaves to one man because they could not say
the one syllable No, spoke in jest and not in earnest; but bashful
persons, even if they say nothing, can by raising or dropping their
eyebrows decline many disagreeable and unpleasant acts of
compliance. For Euripides says, "Silence is an answer to wise
men,"<a name="FNanchor_659_659" id="FNanchor_659_659"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_659_659" class="fnanchor">659</a> but we stand more in
need of it to inconsiderate persons, for we can talk over the
sensible. And indeed it is well to have at hand and frequently on
our lips the sayings<a name="FNanchor_660_660" id=
"FNanchor_660_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_660" class=
"fnanchor">660</a> of good and famous men to quote to those who
importune us, as that of Phocion to Antipater, "You cannot have me
both as a friend and flatterer;" or his remark to the Athenians,
when they applauded him <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261"
id="Page_261">261</a></span>and bade him contribute to the expenses
of a festival, "I am ashamed to contribute anything to you, till I
have paid yonder person my debts to him," pointing out his creditor
Callicles. For, as Thucydides says, "It is not disgraceful to admit
one's poverty, but it is very much so not to try to mend it."<a
name="FNanchor_661_661" id="FNanchor_661_661"></a><a href=

Helicon of Cyzicus a letter for Dionysius, praised the bearer as a
man of goodness and moderation, but added at the end of the letter,
"I write you this about a man, an animal by nature apt to change."
But Xenocrates, though a man of austere character, was prevailed
upon through his bashfulness to recommend to Polysperchon by
letter, one who was no good man as the event showed; for when the
Macedonian welcomed him, and inquired if he wanted any money, he
asked for a talent, and Polysperchon gave it him, but wrote to
Xenocrates advising him for the future to be more careful in the
choice of people he recommended. But Xenocrates knew not the
fellow's true character; we on the other <span class='pagenum'><a

know that such and such men are bad, yet give them testimonials and
money, doing ourselves injury, and not getting any pleasure for it,
as people do get in the company of whores and flatterers, but being
vexed and disgusted at the importunity that has upset and forced
our reason. For the line</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p>is especially applicable to people that importune us, when one
is going to perjure oneself, or deliver an unjust verdict, or vote
for a measure that is inexpedient, or borrow money for someone who
will never pay it back.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xii.</span> And so repentance follows
more closely upon bashfulness than upon any emotion, and that not
afterwards, but in the very act. For we are vexed with ourselves
when we give, and ashamed when we perjure ourselves, and get
ill-fame from our advocacies, and are put to the blush, when we
cannot fulfil our promises. For frequently, from inability to say
No, we promise impossibilities to persevering applicants, as
introductions at court, and audiences with princes, from reluctance
or want of nerve to say, "The king does not know us, others have
his regard far more." But Lysander, when he was out of favour with
Agesilaus, though he was thought to have very great influence with
him owing to his great reputation, was not ashamed to dismiss
suitors, and bid them go and pay their court to others who had more
influence with the king. For not to be able to do everything
carries no disgrace with it, but to undertake and try and force
your way to what you are unable to do, or unqualified by nature
for, is in addition to the disgrace incurred a task full of
trouble.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> To take another element
into consideration, all seemly and modest requests we ought readily
to comply with, not bashfully but heartily, whereas in injurious or
unreasonable requests we ought ever to remember the conduct of
Zeno, who, meeting a young man he knew walking very quietly near a
wall, and learning from him that he was trying to get out of the
way of a friend who wanted him to perjure himself on his behalf,
said to him, "O stupid fellow, what do you tell me? Is he not
afraid or ashamed to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id=

not you stand up boldly against him for what is right?" For he that

"#Footnote_667_667" class="fnanchor">667</a> taught people the bad
practice of standing on one's defence against vice by imitating it;
but to get rid of those who shamelessly and unblushingly importune
us by their own effrontery, and not to gratify the immodest in
their disgraceful desires through false modesty, is the right and
proper conduct of sensible people.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> Moreover it is no great
task to resist disreputable and low and worthless fellows who
importune you, but some send such off with a laugh or a jest, as
Theocritus did, who, when two fellows in the public baths, one a
stranger, the other a well-known thief, wanted to borrow his
scraper,<a name="FNanchor_668_668" id="FNanchor_668_668"></a><a
href="#Footnote_668_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> put them both off
with a playful answer, "You, sir, I don't know, and you I know too
well." And Lysimache,<a name="FNanchor_669_669" id=
"FNanchor_669_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_669" class=
"fnanchor">669</a> the priestess of Athene Polias at Athens, when
some muleteers that bore the sacred vessels asked her to give them
a drink, answered, "I hesitate to do so from fear that you would
make a practice of it." And when a certain young man, the son of a
distinguished officer, but himself effeminate and far from bold,
asked Antigonus for promotion, he replied, "With me, young man,
honours are given for personal prowess, not for the prowess of
ancestors."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> But if the person that
importunes us be famous or a man of power, for such persons are
very hard to move by entreaty or to get rid of when they come to
sue for your vote and interest, it will not perhaps be easy or even
necessary to behave as Cato, when quite a young man, did to
Catulus. Catulus was in the highest repute at Rome, and at that
time held the office of censor, and went to Cato, who then held the
office of qu&aelig;stor, and tried to beg off someone whom he had
fined, and was urgent and even violent in his petitions, till Cato
at last lost all patience, and said, "To have you, the censor,
removed by my officers against your will, Catulus, would not be a
seemly thing for you." So Catulus felt ashamed, and went off in a
rage. But see <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id=
"Page_264">264</a></span>whether the answers of Agesilaus and
Themistocles are not more modest and in better form. Agesilaus,
when he was asked by his father to pronounce sentence contrary to
the law, said, "Father, I was taught by you even from my earliest
years to obey the laws, so now I shall obey you and do nothing
contrary to law." And Themistocles, when Simonides asked him to do
something unjust, replied, "Neither would you be a good poet if
your lines violated the laws of metre, nor should I be a good
magistrate if I gave decisions contrary to law."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> And yet it is not on
account of want of metrical harmony in respect to the lyre, to
borrow the words of Plato, that cities quarrel with cities and
friends with friends, and do and suffer the worst woes, but on
account of deviations<a name="FNanchor_670_670" id=
"FNanchor_670_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_670" class=
"fnanchor">670</a> from law and justice. And yet some, who
themselves pay great attention to melody and letters and measures,
do not think it wrong for others to neglect what is right in
magistracies and judicial sentences and business generally. One
must therefore deal with them in the following manner. Does an
orator ask a favour of you when you are acting as juryman, or a
demagogue when you are sitting in council? Say you will grant his
request if he first utter a solecism, or introduce a barbarism into
his speech; he will refuse because of the shame that would attach
itself to him; at any rate we see some that will not in a speech
let two vowels come together. If again some illustrious and
distinguished person importune you to something bad, bid him come
into the market-place dancing or making wry faces, and if he refuse
you will have an opportunity to speak, and ask him which is more
disgraceful, to utter a solecism and make wry faces, or to violate
the law and one's oath, and contrary to justice to do more for a
bad than for a good man. Nicostratus the Argive, when Archidamus
offered him a large sum of money and any Laced&aelig;monian bride
he chose if he would deliver up Cromnum, said Archidamus could not
be a descendant of Hercules, for he travelled about and killed
evil-doers, whereas Archidamus tried to make evil-doers of <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>the
good. In like manner, if a man of good repute tries to force and
importune us to something bad, let us tell him that he is acting in
an ignoble way, and not as his birth and virtue would warrant.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvii.</span> But in the case of
people of no repute you must see whether you can persuade the miser
by your importunity to lend you money without a bond, or the proud
man to yield you the better place, or the ambitious man to
surrender some office to you when he might take it himself. For
truly it would seem monstrous that, while such remain firm and
inflexible and unmoveable in their vicious propensities, we who
wish to be, and profess to be, men of honour and justice should be
so little masters of ourselves as to abandon and betray virtue. For
indeed, if those who importune us do it for glory and power, it is
absurd that we should adorn and aggrandize others only to get
infamy and a bad name ourselves; like unfair umpires in the public
games, or like people voting only to ingratiate themselves, and so
bestowing improperly offices and prizes<a name="FNanchor_671_671"
id="FNanchor_671_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_671" class=
"fnanchor">671</a> and glory on others, while they rob themselves
of respect and fair fame. And if we see that the person who
importunes us only does so for money, does it not occur to one that
it is monstrous to be prodigal of one's own fame and reputation
merely to make somebody else's purse heavier? Why the idea must
occur to most people, they sin with their eyes open; like people
who are urged hard to toss off big bumpers, and grunt and groan and
make wry faces, but at last do as they are told.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xviii.</span> Such weakness of mind
is like a temperament of body equally susceptible to heat and cold;
for if such people are praised by those that importune them they
are overcome and yield at once, whereas they are mortally afraid of
the blame and suspicions of those whose desires they do not comply
with. But we ought to be stout and resolute in either case, neither
yielding to bullying nor cajolery. Thucydides indeed tells us,
since envy necessarily follows ability, that "he is well advised
who incurs envy in matters of the highest importance."<a name=
"FNanchor_672_672" id="FNanchor_672_672"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_672_672" class="fnanchor">672</a> But we, thinking it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id=
"Page_266">266</a></span>difficult to escape envy, and seeing that
it is altogether impossible not to incur blame or give offence to
those we live with, shall be well advised if we prefer the hatred
of the perverse to that of those who might justly find fault with
us for having iniquitously served their turn. And indeed we ought
to be on our guard against praise from those who importune us,
which is sure to be altogether insincere, and not to resemble
swine, readily allowing anyone that presses to make use of us from
our pleasure at itching and tickling, and submitting ourselves to
their will. For those that give their ears to flatterers differ not
a whit from such as let themselves be tripped up at wrestling, only
their overthrow and fall is more disgraceful; some forbearing
hostility and reproof in the case of bad men, that they may be
called merciful and humane and compassionate; and others on the
contrary persuaded to take up unnecessary and dangerous animosities
and charges by those who praise them as the only men, the only
people that never flatter, and go so far as to entitle them their
mouthpieces and voices. Accordingly Bio<a name="FNanchor_673_673"
id="FNanchor_673_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_673" class=
"fnanchor">673</a> compared such people to jars, that you could
easily take by the ears and turn about at your will. Thus it is
recorded that the sophist Alexinus in one of his lectures said a
good many bad things about Stilpo the Megarian, but when one of
those that were present said, "Why, he was speaking in your praise
only the other day," he replied, "I don't doubt it; for he is the
best and noblest of men." Menedemus on the contrary, having heard
that Alexinus<a name="FNanchor_674_674" id=
"FNanchor_674_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674_674" class=
"fnanchor">674</a> frequently praised him, replied, "But I always
censure him, for that man is bad who either praises a bad man or is
blamed by a good." So inflexible and proof was he against such
flattery, and master of that advice which Hercules in Antisthenes<a
name="FNanchor_675_675" id="FNanchor_675_675"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_675_675" class="fnanchor">675</a> gave, when he ordered
his sons to be grateful to no one that praised them; which meant
nothing else than that they should not be dumbfoundered at it, nor
flatter again those who praised them. Very apt, I take it, <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>was
the remark of Pindar to one who told him that he praised him
everywhere and to all persons, "I am greatly obliged to you, and
will make your account true by my actions."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xix.</span> A useful precept in
reference to all passions is especially valuable in the case of the
bashful. When they have been overcome by this infirmity, and
against their judgement have erred and been confounded, let them
fix it in their memories, and, remembering the pain and grief it
gave them, let them recall it to their mind and be on their guard
for a very long time. For as travellers that have stumbled against
a stone, or pilots that have been wrecked off a headland, if they
remember these occurrences, not only dread and are on their guard
continually on those spots, but also on all similar ones; so those
that frequently remember the disgrace and injury that bashfulness
brought them, and its sorrow and anguish, will in similar cases be
on their guard against their weakness, and will not readily allow
themselves to be subjugated by it again.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_267a" id="Page_267a">ON RESTRAINING ANGER.</a></h3>

<h4>A DIALOGUE BETWEEN SYLLA AND FUNDANUS.</h4>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> <i>Sylla.</i> Those
painters, Fundanus, seem to me to do well who, before giving the
finishing touches to their paintings, lay them by for a time and
then revise them; because by taking their eyes off them for a time
they gain by frequent inspection a new insight, and are more apt to
detect minute differences, that continuous familiarity would have
hidden. Now since a human being cannot so separate himself from
himself for a time, and make a break in his continuity, and then
approach himself again&mdash;and that is perhaps the chief reason
why a man is a worse judge of himself than of others&mdash;the next
best thing will be for a man to inspect his friends after an
interval, and likewise offer himself to their scrutiny, not to see
whether he has aged quickly, or whether his bodily condition is
better or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id=
"Page_268">268</a></span> worse, but to examine his moral
character, and see whether time has added any good quality, or
removed any bad one. On my return then to Rome after an absence of
two years, and having been with you now five months, I am not at
all surprised that there has been a great increase and growth in
those good points which you formerly had owing to your admirable
nature; but when I see how gentle and obedient to reason your
former excessive impetuosity and hot temper has become, it cannot
but occur to me to quote the line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Ye gods, how much more mild
is he become!"<a name="FNanchor_676_676" id=
"FNanchor_676_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_676" class=
"fnanchor">676</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>And this mildness has not wrought in you sloth or weakness, but
like cultivation of the soil it has produced a smoothness and depth
fit for action, instead of the former impetuosity and vehemence.
And so it is clear that your propensity to anger has not been
effaced by any declining vigour or through some chance, but has
been cured by good precepts. And indeed, for I will tell you the
truth, when our friend Eros<a name="FNanchor_677_677" id=
"FNanchor_677_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_677" class=
"fnanchor">677</a> reported this change in you to me, I suspected
that owing to goodwill he bare witness not of the actual state of
the case, but of what was becoming to all good and virtuous men,
although, as you know, he can never be persuaded to depart from his
real opinion to ingratiate himself with anyone. But now he is
acquitted of false witness, and do you, as your journey gives you
leisure, narrate to me the mode of cure you employed to make your
temper so under control, so natural, gentle and obedient to
reason.</p>

<p><i>Fundanus.</i> Most friendly Sylla, take care that you do not
in your goodwill and affection to me rest under any misconception
of my real condition. For it is possible that Eros, not being able
always himself to keep his temper in its place in the obedience
that Homer speaks of,<a name="FNanchor_678_678" id=
"FNanchor_678_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_678" class=
"fnanchor">678</a> but sometimes carried away by his hatred of what
is bad, may think me grown milder than I really am, as in changes
of the scale in music the lowest notes become the highest.</p>

<p><i>Sylla.</i> Neither of these is the case, Fundanus, but oblige
me by doing as I ask.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id=

<i>Fundanus.</i> One of the excellent precepts then of Musonius
that I remember, Sylla, is this, that those who wish to be well
should diet themselves all their life long. For I do not think we
must employ reason as a cure, as we do hellebore, by purging it out
with the disease, but we must retain it in the soul, to restrain
and govern the judgement. For the power of reason is not like
physic, but wholesome food, which co-operates with good health in
producing a good habit of body in those by whom it is taken. But
admonition and reproof, when passion is at its height and swelling,
does little or no good, but resembles very closely those
strong-smelling substances, that are able to set on their legs
again those that have fallen in epileptic fits, but cannot rid them
of their disease. For although all other passions, even at the
moment of their acme, do in some sort listen to reason and admit it
into the soul, yet anger does not, for, as Melanthius says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Fell things it does when it
the mind unsettles,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>for it absolutely turns reason out of doors, and bolts it out,
and, like those persons who burn themselves and houses together, it
makes all the interior full of confusion and smoke and noise, so
that what would be advantageous can neither be seen nor heard. And
so an empty ship in a storm at open sea would sooner admit on board
a pilot from without, than a man in a tempest of rage and anger
would listen to another's advice, unless his own reason was first
prepared to hearken. But as those who expect a siege get together
and store up supplies, when they despair of relief from without, so
ought we by all means to scour the country far and wide to derive
aids against anger from philosophy, and store them up in the soul:
for, when the time of need comes, we shall find it no easy task to
import them. For either the soul doesn't hear what is said without
because of the uproar, if it have not within its own reason (like a
boatswain as it were) to receive at once and understand every
exhortation; or if it does hear, it despises what is uttered mildly
and gently, while it is exasperated by harsh censure. For anger
being haughty and self-willed and hard to be worked upon by
another, like a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id=
"Page_270">270</a></span> fortified tyranny, must have someone born
and bred within it<a name="FNanchor_679_679" id=
"FNanchor_679_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_679" class=
"fnanchor">679</a> to overthrow it.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> Now long-continued anger,
and frequent giving way to it, produces an evil disposition of
soul, which people call irascibility, and which ends in
passionateness, bitterness, and peevishness, whenever the mind
becomes sore and vexed at trifles and querulous at everyday
occurrences, like iron thin and beaten out too fine. But when the
judgement checks and suppresses at once the rising anger, it not
only cures the soul for the moment, but restores its tone and
balance for the future. It has happened to myself indeed twice or
thrice, when I strongly fought against anger, that I was in the
same plight as the Thebans, who after they had once defeated the
Laced&aelig;monians, whom they had hitherto thought invincible,
never lost a battle against them again. I then felt confident that
reason can win the victory. I saw also that anger is not only
appeased by the sprinkling of cold water, as Aristotle attested,
but is also extinguished by the action of fear; aye, and, as Homer
tells us, anger has been cured and has melted away in the case of
many by some sudden joy. So that I came to the conclusion that this
passion is not incurable for those who wish to be cured. For it
does not arise from great and important causes, but banter and
joking, a laugh or a nod, and similar trifles make many angry, as
Helen by addressing her niece,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Electra, maiden now for no

<p>and Callisthenes incensed Alexander, by saying, when a huge cup
was brought to him, "I will not drink to Alexander till I shall
require the help of &AElig;sculapius."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> As then it is easy to put
out a flame kindled in the hair of hares and in wicks and rubbish,
but if it once gets hold of things solid and thick, it quickly
destroys and consumes them, "raging amidst the lofty work of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id=

"FNanchor_682_682" id="FNanchor_682_682"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_682_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> says; so he that
observes anger in its rise, and sees it gradually smoking and
bursting forth into fire from some chatter or rubbishy scurrility,
need have no great trouble with it, but can frequently smother it
merely by silence and contempt. For as a person puts out a fire by
bringing no fuel to it, so with respect to anger, he that does not
in the beginning fan it, and stir up its rage in himself, keeps it
off and destroys it. And so, though Hieronymus has given us many
useful sayings and precepts, I am not pleased with his remark that
there is no perception of anger in its birth, but only in its
actual developement, so quick is it. For none of the passions when
stirred up and set in motion has so palpable a birth and growth as
anger. As indeed Homer skilfully shows us, where he represents
Achilles as seized at once with grief, when word was brought him
<i>of Patroclus' death</i>, in the line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Thus spake he, and grief's
dark cloud covered him;"<a name="FNanchor_683_683" id=

<p>whereas he represents him as waxing angry with Agamemnon slowly,
and as inflamed by his many words, which if either of them<a name=
"FNanchor_684_684" id="FNanchor_684_684"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_684_684" class="fnanchor">684</a> had abstained from,
their quarrel would not have attained such growth and magnitude.
And so Socrates, as often as he perceived any anger rising in him
against any of his friends, "setting himself like some ocean
promontory to break the violence of the waves," would lower his
voice, and put on a smiling countenance, and give his eye a gentler
expression, by inclining in the other direction and running counter
to his passion, thus keeping himself from fall and defeat.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> For the first way, my
friend, to overcome anger, like the putting down of some tyrant, is
not to obey or listen to it when it bids you speak loud, and look
fierce, and beat yourself, but to remain quiet, and not to make the
passion more intense, as one would a disease, by tossing about and
crying out. In love affairs indeed, such things as revellings, and
serenadings, and crowning the loved <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>one's door with garlands,
may indeed bring some pleasant and elegant relief.</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>In the case of mourners also giving up to weeping and wailing
takes away with the tears much of the grief. But anger on the
contrary is much more fanned by what angry persons do and say. It
is best therefore to be calm, or to flee and hide ourselves and go
to a haven of quiet, when we feel the fit of temper coming upon us
as an epileptic fit, that we fall not, or rather fall not on
others, for it is our friends that we fall upon most and most
frequently. For we do not love all, nor envy all, nor fear all men;
but nothing is untouched or unassailed by anger; for we are angry
with friends and enemies, parents and children, aye, and with the
gods, and beasts, and even things inanimate, as was Thamyris,</p>

stripes and blows on the sea, and sent letters to Mount Athos,
"Divine Athos, whose top reaches heaven, put not in the way of my
works stones large and difficult to deal with, or else I will hew
thee down, and throw thee into the sea." For anger has many
formidable aspects, and many ridiculous ones, so that of all the
passions it is the most hated and despised. It will be well to
consider both aspects.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> To begin then, whether my
process was wrong or right I know not, but I began my cure of anger
by noticing its effects in others, as the Laced&aelig;monians study
the nature of drunkenness in the Helots. And in the first place, as
Hippocrates tells us that disease is most dangerous in which the
face of the patient is most unlike himself, so observing that
people beside themselves with anger <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>change their face, colour,
walk, and voice, I formed an impression as it were of that aspect
of passion, and was very disgusted with myself if ever I should
appear so frightful and like one out of his mind to my friends and
wife and daughters, not only wild and unlike oneself in appearance,
but also with a voice savage and harsh, as I had noticed in some<a
name="FNanchor_688_688" id="FNanchor_688_688"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_688_688" class="fnanchor">688</a> of my acquaintance,
who could neither preserve for anger their ordinary behaviour, or
demeanour, or grace of language, or persuasiveness and gentleness
in conversation. Caius Gracchus, indeed, the orator, whose
character was harsh and style of oratory impassioned, had a
pitch-pipe made for him, such as musicians use to heighten or lower
their voices by degrees, and this, when he was making a speech, a
slave stood behind him and held, and used to give him a mild and
gentle note on it, whereby he lowered his key, and removed from his
voice the harsh and passionate element, charming and laying the
heat of the orator,</p>

<p>For myself if I had some elegant and sprightly companion, I
should not be vexed at his showing me a looking-glass in my fits of
anger, as they offer one to some after a bath to little useful end.
For to behold oneself unnaturally distorted in countenance will
condemn anger in no small degree. The poets playfully tell us that
Athene when playing on the pipe was rebuked thus by a Satyr,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"That look no way becomes you,
take your armour,</span> <span class="i0">Lay down your pipes, and
do compose your cheeks,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>and though she paid no attention to him, yet afterwards when she
saw her face in a river, she felt vexed and threw her pipes away,
although art had made melody a compensation for her unsightliness.
And Marsyas, it seems, by a sort of mouthpiece forcibly repressed
the violence of his breath, and tricked up and hid the contortion
of his face,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Around his shaggy temples put

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id=

face so as to look ugly, utters a voice still more harsh and

</div>

<p>They say that the sea is cleansed when agitated by the winds it
throws up tangle and seaweed; but the intemperate and bitter and
vain words, which the mind throws up when the soul is agitated,
defile the speakers of them first of all and fill them with infamy,
as always having those thoughts within their bosom and being
defiled with them, but only giving vent to them in anger. And so
for a word which is, as Plato styles it, "a very small matter,"
they incur a most heavy punishment, for they get reputed to be
enemies, and evil speakers, and malignant in disposition.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> Seeing and observing all
this, it occurs to me to take it as a matter of fact, and record it
for my own general use, that if it is good to keep the tongue soft
and smooth in a fever, it is better to keep it so in anger. For if
the tongue of people in a fever be unnatural, it is a bad sign, but
not the cause of their malady; but the tongue of angry people,
being rough and foul, and breaking out into unseemly speeches,
produces insults that work irremediable mischief, and argue
deep-rooted malevolence within. For wine drunk neat does not
exhibit the soul in so ungovernable and hateful a condition as
temper does: for the outbreaks of the one smack of laughter and
fun, while those of the other are compounded with gall: and at a
drinking-bout he that is silent is burdensome to the company and
tiresome, whereas in anger nothing is more highly thought of than
silence, as Sappho advises,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"When anger's busy in the
brain</span> <span class="i0">Thy idly-barking tongue
restrain."</span></div>
</div>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> And not only does the
consideration of all this naturally arise from observing ourselves
in the moments of anger, but we cannot help seeing also the other
properties of rage, how ignoble it is, how unmanly, how devoid of
dignity and greatness of mind! And yet to most people its noise
seems vigour, its threatening confidence, and its obstinacy force
of character; some even not wisely entitle its savageness
magnanimity, and its implacability firmness,<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span> and its
morosity hatred of what is bad. For their actions and motions and
whole demeanour argue great littleness and meanness, not only when
they are fierce with little boys, and peevish with women, and think
it right to treat dogs and horses and mules with harshness, as
Ctesiphon the pancratiast thought fit to kick back a mule that had
kicked him, but even in the butcheries that tyrants commit their
littleness of soul is apparent in their savageness, and their
suffering in their action, so that they are like the bites of
serpents, that, when they are burnt and smart with pain, violently
thrust their venom on those that have hurt them. For as a swelling
is produced in the flesh by a heavy blow, so in softest souls the
inclination to hurt others gets its greater strength from greater
weakness. Thus women are more prone to anger than men, and people
ill than people well, and old men than men in their prime, and the
unfortunate than the prosperous; the miser is most prone to anger
with his steward, the glutton with his cook, the jealous man with
his wife, the vain man when he is spoken ill of; and worst of all
are those "men who are too eager in states for office, or to head a
faction, a manifest sorrow," to borrow Pindar's words. So from the
very great pain and suffering of the soul there arises mainly from
weakness anger, which is not like the nerves of the soul, as some
one defined it, but like its strainings and convulsions when it is
excessively vehement in its thirst for revenge.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> Such bad examples as these
were not pleasant to look at but necessary, but I shall now proceed
to describe people who have been mild and easy in dealing with
anger, conduct gratifying either to see or hear about, being
utterly disgusted<a name="FNanchor_690_690" id=
"FNanchor_690_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_690" class=
"fnanchor">690</a> with people who use such language as,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"You have a man wronged: shall
a man stand this?"</span></div>
</div>

<p>and,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Put your heel upon his neck,
and dash his head against the ground,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>and other provoking expressions such as these, by which some not
well have transferred anger from the woman's <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>side of
the house to the man's. For manliness in all other respects seems
to resemble justice, and to differ from it only in respect to
gentleness, with which it has more affinities. For it sometimes
happens to worse men to govern better ones, but to erect a trophy
in the soul against anger (which Heraclitus says it is difficult to
contend against, for whatever it wishes is bought at the price of
the soul), is a proof of power so great and victorious as to be
able to apply the judgement as if it were nerves and sinews to the
passions. So I always try to collect and peruse the remarks on this
subject not only of the philosophers, who foolish<a name=
"FNanchor_691_691" id="FNanchor_691_691"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_691_691" class="fnanchor">691</a> people say had no gall
in their composition, but still more of kings and tyrants. Such was
the remark of Antigonus to his soldiers, when they were abusing him
near his tent as if he were not listening, so he put his staff out,
and said, "What's to do? can you not go rather farther off to run
me down?" And when Arcadio the Ach&aelig;an, who was always railing
against Philip, and advising people to flee</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Unto a country where they
knew not Philip,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>visited Macedonia afterwards on some chance or other, the king's
friends thought he ought to be punished and the matter not looked
over; but Philip treated him kindly, and sent him presents and
gifts, and afterwards bade inquiry to be made as to what sort of
account of him Arcadio now gave to the Greeks; and when all
testified that the fellow had become a wonderful praiser of the
king, Philip said, "You see I knew how to cure him better than all
of you." And at the Olympian games when there was defamation of
Philip, and some of his suite said to him, that the Greeks ought to
smart for it, because they railed against him when they were
treated well by him, he replied, "What will they do then if they
are treated badly by me?" Excellent also was the behaviour of
Pisistratus to Thrasybulus, and of Porsena to Mucius, and of Magas
to Philemon. As to Magas, after he had been publicly jeered at by
Philemon in one of his comedies at the theatre in the following
words,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id=
"Page_277">277</a></span> <span class="i0">"Magas, the king hath
written thee a letter,</span> <span class="i0">Unhappy Magas, since
thou can'st not read,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>after having taken Philemon, who had been cast on shore by a
storm at Par&aelig;tonium, he commanded one of his soldiers only to
touch his neck with the naked sword and then to go away quietly,
and dismissed him, after sending him a ball and some dice as if he
were a silly boy. And Ptolemy on one occasion, flouting a
grammarian for his ignorance, asked him who was the father of
Peleus, and he answered, "I will tell you, if you tell me first who
was the father of Lagus." This was a jeer at the obscure birth of
the king, and all his courtiers were indignant at it as an
unpardonable liberty; but Ptolemy said, "If it is not kingly to
take a flout, neither is it kingly to give one." And Alexander was
more savage than usual in his behaviour to Callisthenes and Clitus.
So Porus, when he was taken captive, begged Alexander to use him as
a king. And on his inquiring, "What, nothing more?" he replied "No.
For everything is included in being used as a king." So they call
the king of the gods Milichius,<a name="FNanchor_692_692" id=
"FNanchor_692_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_692" class=
"fnanchor">692</a> while they call Ares Maimactes;<a name=
"FNanchor_693_693" id="FNanchor_693_693"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_693_693" class="fnanchor">693</a> and punishment and
torture they assign to the Erinnyes and to demons, not to the gods
or Olympus.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> As then a certain person
passed the following remark on Philip when he had razed Olynthus to
the ground, "He certainly could not build such another city," so we
may say to anger, "You can root up, and destroy, and throw down,
but to raise up and save and spare and tolerate is the work of
mildness and moderation, the work of a Camillus, a Metellus, an
Aristides, a Socrates; but to sting and bite is to resemble the ant
and horse-fly. For, indeed, when I consider revenge, I find its
angry method to be for the most part ineffectual, since it spends
itself in biting the lips and gnashing the teeth, and in vain
attacks, and in railings coupled with foolish threats, and
eventually resembles children running races, who from feebleness
ridiculously tumble down before they reach the goal they are
hastening to. So that speech of the Rhodian to a <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>lictor of
the Roman pr&aelig;tor who was shouting and talking insolently was
not inapt, "It is no matter to me what you say, but what your
master thinks."<a name="FNanchor_694_694" id=
"FNanchor_694_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_694" class=
"fnanchor">694</a> And Sophocles, when he had introduced
Neoptolemus and Eurypylus as armed for the battle, gives them this
high commendation,<a name="FNanchor_695_695" id=
"FNanchor_695_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_695" class=

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"They rushed into the midst of
armed warriors."</span></div>
</div>

<p>Some barbarians indeed poison their steel, but bravery has no
need of gall, being dipped in reason, but rage and fury are not
invincible but rotten. And so the Laced&aelig;monians by their
pipes turn away the anger of their warriors, and sacrifice to the
Muses before commencing battle, that reason may abide with them,
and when they have routed a foe do not follow up the victory,<a
name="FNanchor_696_696" id="FNanchor_696_696"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_696_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> but relax their rage,
which like small daggers they can easily take back. But anger kills
myriads before it is glutted with revenge, as happened in the case
of Cyrus and Pelopidas the Theban. But Agathocles bore mildly the
revilings of those he was besieging, and when one of them cried
out, "Potter, how are you going to get money to pay your
mercenaries?" he replied laughingly, "Out of your town if I take
it." And when some of those on the wall threw his ugliness into the
teeth of Antigonus, he said to them, "I thought I was rather a
handsome fellow." But after he had taken the town, he sold for
slaves those that had flouted him, protesting that, if they
insulted him again, he would bring the matter before their masters.
I have noticed also that hunters and orators are very unsuccessful
when they give way to anger.<a name="FNanchor_697_697" id=
"FNanchor_697_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_697" class=
"fnanchor">697</a> And Aristotle tells us that the friends of
Satyrus stopped up his ears with wax when he was to plead a cause,
that he might not make any confusion in the case through rage at
the abuse of his enemies. And does it not frequently happen with
ourselves that a slave who has offended escapes punishment, because
they abscond in fear of our threats and harsh words? What nurses
then say to children, "Give up crying, and you shall have it," may
usefully be applied to anger, thus, "Do not be in a hurry, or bawl
out, or be vehement, and you will sooner <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>and better get what you
want." For a father, seeing his boy trying to cut or cleave
something with a knife, takes the knife from him and does it
himself: and similarly a person, taking revenge out of the hand of
passion, does himself safely and usefully and without harm punish
the person who deserves punishment, and not himself instead, as
anger often does.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xi.</span> Now though all the
passions need such discipline as by exercise shall tame and subdue
their unreasoning and disobedient elements, yet there is none which
we ought to keep under by such discipline so much as the exhibition
of anger to our servants. For neither envy, nor fear, nor rivalry
come into play between them and us; but our frequent displays of
anger to them, creating many offences and faults, make us to slip
as if on slippery ground owing to our autocracy with our servants,
which no one resists or prevents. For it is impossible to check
irresponsible power so as never to break out under the influence of
passion, unless one wields power with much meekness, and refuses to
listen to the frequent complaints of one's wife and friends
charging one with being too easy and lax with one's servants. And
by nothing have I been more exasperated against them, as if they
were being ruined for want of correction. At last, though late, I
got to see that in the first place it is better to make them worse
by forbearance, than by bitterness and anger to distort oneself for
the correction of others. In the next place I observed that many
for the very reason that they were not corrected were frequently
ashamed to be bad, and made pardon rather than punishment the
commencement of their reformation, aye, and made better slaves to
some merely at their nod silently and cheerfully than to others
with all their beatings and brandings, and so I came to the
conclusion that reason gets better obeyed than temper, for it is
not as the poet said,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Where there is fear, there
too is self-respect,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>but it is just the other way about, for self-respect begets that
kind of fear that corrects the behaviour. But perpetual and
pitiless beating produces not so much repentance for wrong-doing as
contrivances to continue in it without detection. In the third
place, ever remembering and reflecting <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>within myself that,
just as he that teaches us the use of the bow does not forbid us to
shoot but only to miss the mark, so it will not prevent punishment
altogether to teach people to do it in season, and with moderation,
utility, and decorum, I strive to remove anger most especially by
not forbidding those who are to be corrected to speak in their
defence, but by listening to them. For the interval of time gives a
pause to passion, and a delay that mitigates it, and so judgement
finds out both the fit manner and adequate amount of punishment.
Moreover he that is punished has nothing to allege against his
correction, if he is punished not in anger but only after his guilt
is brought home to him. And the greatest disgrace will not be
incurred, which is when the servant seems to speak more justly than
the master. As then Phocion, after the death of Alexander, to stop
the Athenians from revolting and believing the news too soon, said
to them, "Men of Athens, if he is dead to-day, he will certainly
also be dead to-morrow and the next day," so I think the man who is
in a hurry to punish anyone in his rage ought to consider with
himself, "If this person has wronged you to-day, he will also have
wronged you to-morrow and the next day; and there will be no harm
done if he shall be punished somewhat late; whereas if he shall be
punished at once, he will always seem to you to have been innocent,
as has often happened before now." For which of us is so savage as
to chastise and scourge a slave because five or ten days before he
over-roasted the meat, or upset the table, or was somewhat tardy on
some errand? And yet these are the very things for which we put
ourselves out and are harsh and implacable, immediately after they
have happened and are recent. For as bodies seem greater in a mist,
so do little matters in a rage. We ought therefore to consider such
arguments as these at once, and if, when there is no trace of
passion left, the matter appear bad to calm and clear reason, then
it ought to be taken in hand, and the punishment ought not to be
neglected or abandoned, as we leave food when we have lost our
appetites. For nothing causes people to punish so much when their
anger is fierce, as that when it is appeased they do not punish at
all, but forget the matter entirely, and resemble lazy rowers,<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span> who
lie in harbour when the sea is calm, and then sail out to their
peril when the wind gets up. So we, condemning reason for slackness
and mildness in punishing, are in a hurry to punish, borne along by
passion as by a dangerous gale. He that is hungry takes his food as
nature dictates, but he that punishes should have no hunger or
thirst for it, nor require anger as a sauce to stimulate him to it,
but should punish when he is as far as possible from having any
desire for it, and has to compel his reason to it. For we ought
not, as Aristotle tells us slaves in his time were scourged in
Etruria to the music of the flute, to go headlong into punishing
with a desire and zest for it, and to delight in punishing, and
then afterwards to be sorry at it&mdash;for the first is savage,
and the last womanish&mdash;but we should without either sorrow or
pleasure chastise at the dictates of reason, giving anger no
opportunity to interfere.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xii.</span> But this perhaps will not
appear a cure of anger so much as a putting away and avoiding such
faults as men commit in anger. And yet, though the swelling of the
spleen is only a symptom of fever, the fever is assuaged by its
abating, as Hieronymus tells us. Now when I contemplated the origin
of anger itself, I observed that, though different persons fell
into it for different reasons, yet in nearly all of them was the
idea of their being despised and neglected to be found. So we ought
to help those who try to get rid of anger, by removing as far as
possible from them any action savouring of contempt or contumely,
and by looking upon their anger as folly or necessity, or emotion,
or mischance, as Sophocles says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"In those that are
unfortunate, O king,</span> <span class="i0">No mind stays firm,
but all their balance lose."<a name="FNanchor_698_698" id=

</div>

<p>And so Agamemnon, ascribing to Ate his carrying off Briseis, yet
says to Achilles,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I wish to please you in

"fnanchor">699</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>For suing is not the action of one who shews his contempt, and
when he that has done an injury is humble he removes <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>all idea
of slighting one. But the angry person must not expect this, but
rather take to himself the answer of Diogenes, who, when it was
said to him, "These people laugh at you," replied, "But I am not
one to be laughed at," and not think himself despised, but rather
despise the person who gave the offence, as acting from weakness,
or error, or rashness, or heedlessness, or illiberality, or old
age, or youth. Nor must we entertain such notions with regard to
our servants and friends. For they do not despise us as void of
ability or energy, but owing to our evenness and good-nature, some
because we are mild, and others presuming on our affection for
them. But as it is we not only fly into rages with wife and slaves
and friends, as if we were slighted by them, but we also
frequently, from forming the same idea of being slighted, fall foul
of innkeepers and sailors and muleteers, and are vexed at dogs that
bark and asses that are in our way: like the man who was going to
beat an ass-driver, but when he cried out he was an Athenian, he
said to the ass, "You are not an Athenian anyway," and beat it with
many stripes.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> Moreover those
continuous and frequent fits of anger that gather together in the
soul by degrees, like a swarm of bees or wasps, are generated
within us by selfishness and peevishness, luxury and softness. And
so nothing causes us to be mild to our servants and wife and
friends so much as easiness and simplicity, and the learning to be
content with what we have, and not to require a quantity of
superfluities.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"He who likes not his meat if

</div>

<p>but will not drink unless he have snow to cool his drink, nor
eat bread purchased in the market, nor touch food served on cheap
or earthenware plates, nor sleep upon any but a feather bed that
rises and falls like the sea stirred up from its depths, and with
rods and blows hastens his servants at table, so that they run
about and cry out and sweat as if they were bringing poultices to
sores, he is slave to a weak querulous and discontented mode of
life, and, like one who has a continual cough or various ailments,
whether he is aware of it or not, he is in an<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span> ulcerous
and catarrh-like condition as regards his proneness to anger. We
must therefore train the body to contentment by plain living, that
it may be easily satisfied: for they that require little do not
miss much; and it is no great hardship to begin with our food, and
take it silently whatever it is, and not by being choleric and
peevish to thrust upon ourselves and friends the worst sauce to
meat, anger.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"No more unpleasant supper

<p>than that wherein the servants are beaten, and the wife scolded,
because something is burnt or smoked or not salt enough, or because
the bread is too cold. Arcesilaus was once entertaining some
friends and strangers, and when dinner was served, there was no
bread, through the servants having neglected to buy any. In such a
case as this which of us would not have broken the walls with
vociferation? But he only smiled and said, "How unfit a sage is to
give an entertainment!" And when Socrates once took Euthydemus home
with him from the wrestling-school, Xanthippe was in a towering
rage, and scolded, and at last upset the table, and Euthydemus rose
and went away full of sorrow. But Socrates said to him, "Did not a
hen at your house the other day fly in and act in the very same
way? And we did not put ourselves out about it." We ought to
receive our friends with gaiety and smiles and welcome, not
knitting our brows, or inspiring fear and trembling in the
attendants. We ought also to accustom ourselves to the use of any
kind of ware at table, and not to stint ourselves to one kind
rather than another, as some pick out a particular tankard or horn,
as they say Marius did, out of many, and will not drink out of
anything else; and some act in the same way with regard to
oil-flasks and scrapers,<a name="FNanchor_701_701" id=
"FNanchor_701_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_701" class=
"fnanchor">701</a> being content with only one out of all, and so,
if such an article is broken or lost, they are very much put out
about it, and punish with severity. He then that is prone to anger
should not use rare and dainty things, such as choice cups and
seals and precious stones: for if they are lost they put a man
beside <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id=
"Page_284">284</a></span>himself much more than the loss of
ordinary and easily got things would do. And so when Nero had got
an eight-cornered tent constructed, a wonderful object both for its
beauty and costliness, Seneca said to him, "You have now shown
yourself to be poor, for if you should lose this, you will not be
able to procure such another." And indeed it did so happen that the
tent was lost by shipwreck, but Nero bore its loss patiently,
remembering what Seneca had said. Now this easiness about things
generally makes a man also easy and gentle to his servants, and if
to them, then it is clear he will be so to his friends also, and to
all that serve under him in any capacity. So we observe that
newly-purchased slaves do not inquire about the master who has
bought them, whether he is superstitious or envious, but only
whether he is a bad-tempered man: and generally speaking we see
that neither can men put up with chaste wives, nor wives with
loving husbands, nor friends with one another, if they be
ill-tempered to boot. So neither marriage nor friendship is
bearable with anger, though without anger even drunkenness is a
small matter. For the wand of Dionysus punishes sufficiently the
drunken man, but if anger be added it turns wine from being the
dispeller of care and inspirer of the dance into a savage and fury.
And simple madness can be cured by Anticyra,<a name=
"FNanchor_702_702" id="FNanchor_702_702"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_702_702" class="fnanchor">702</a> but madness mixed with
anger is the producer of tragedies and dreadful narratives.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> So we ought to give anger
no vent, either in jest, for that draws hatred to friendliness; or
in discussion, for that turns love of learning into strife; or on
the judgement-seat, for that adds insolence to power; or in
teaching, for that produces dejection and hatred of learning: or in
prosperity, for that increases envy; or in adversity, for that
deprives people of compassion, when they are peevish and run
counter to those who condole with them, like Priam,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"A murrain on you, worthless

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id=
"Page_285">285</a></span>Good temper on the other hand is useful in
some circumstances, adorns and sweetens others, and gets the better
of all peevishness and anger by its gentleness. Thus Euclides,<a
name="FNanchor_704_704" id="FNanchor_704_704"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_704_704" class="fnanchor">704</a> when his brother said
to him in a dispute between them, "May I perish, if I don't have my
revenge on you!" replied, "May I perish, if I don't persuade you!"
and so at once turned and changed him. And Polemo, when a man
reviled him who was fond of precious stones and quite crazy for
costly seal-rings, made no answer, but bestowed all his attention
on one of his seal-rings, and eyed it closely; and he being
delighted said, "Do not look at it so, Polemo, but in the light of
the sun, and it will appear to you more beautiful." And Aristippus,
when there was anger between him and &AElig;schines, and somebody
said, "O Aristippus, where is now your friendship?" replied, "It is
asleep, but I will wake it up," and went to &AElig;schines, and
said to him, "Do I seem to you so utterly unfortunate and incurable
as to be unworthy of any consideration?" And &AElig;schines
replied, "It is not at all wonderful that you, being naturally
superior to me in all things, should have been first to detect in
this matter too what was needful."</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"For not a woman only, but

</div>

<p>But we that tame wild beasts and make them gentle, and carry in
our arms young wolves and lions' whelps, inconsistently repel our
children and friends and acquaintances in our rage, and let loose
our temper like some wild beast on our servants and
fellow-citizens, speciously trying to disguise it not rightly under
the name of hatred of evil, but it is, I suppose, as with the other
passions and diseases of the soul, we cannot get rid of any of them
by calling one prudence, and another liberality, and another
piety.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> And yet, as Zeno said the
seed was a mixture and compound drawn from all the faculties of the
soul, so anger seems a universal seed from all the passions. For it
is drawn from pain and pleasure and haughtiness, and from envy it
gets its property of malignity&mdash;and it is even <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>worse than
envy,<a name="FNanchor_705_705" id="FNanchor_705_705"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_705_705" class="fnanchor">705</a> for it does not mind
its own suffering if it can only implicate another in
misery&mdash;and the most unlovely kind of desire is innate in it,
namely the appetite for injuring another. So when we go to the
houses of spendthrifts we hear a flute-playing girl early in the
morning, and see "the dregs of wine," as one said, and fragments of
garlands, and the servants at the doors reeking of yesterday's
debauch; but for tokens of savage and peevish masters these you
will see by the faces, and marks, and manacles of their servants:
for in the house of an angry man</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"The only music ever heard is
wailing,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>stewards being beaten within, and maids tortured, so that the
spectators even in their jollity and pleasure pity these victims of
passion.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> Moreover those to whom it
happens through their genuine hatred of what is bad to be
frequently overtaken by anger, can abate its excess and acerbity by
giving up their excessive confidence in their intimates. For
nothing swells the anger more, than when a good man is detected of
villainy, or one who we thought loved us falls out and jangles with
us. As for my own disposition, you know of course how mightily it
inclines to goodwill and belief in mankind. As then people walking
on empty space,<a name="FNanchor_706_706" id=
"FNanchor_706_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_706" class=
"fnanchor">706</a> the more confidently I believe in anybody's
affection, the more sorrow and distress do I feel if my estimate is
a mistaken one. And indeed I could never divest myself of my ardour
and zeal in affection, but as to trusting people I could perhaps
use Plato's caution as a curb. For he said he so praised Helicon
the mathematician, because he was by nature a changeable animal,
but that he was afraid of those that were well educated in the
city, lest, being human beings and the seed of human beings, they
should reveal by some trait or other the weakness of human nature.
But Sophocles' line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Trace out most human acts,
you'll find them base,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>seems to trample on human nature and lower its merits too <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id=
"Page_287">287</a></span>much. Still such a peevish and
condemnatory verdict as this has a tendency to make people milder
in their rage, for it is the sudden and unexpected that makes
people go distracted. And we ought, as Pan&aelig;tius somewhere
said, to imitate Anaxagoras, and as he said at the death of his
son, "I knew that I had begotten a mortal," so ought every one of
us to use the following kind of language in those contretemps that
stir up our anger, "I knew that the slave I bought was not a
philosopher," "I knew that the friend I had was not perfect," "I
knew that my wife was but a woman." And if anyone would also
constantly put to himself that question of Plato, "Am I myself all
I should be?" and look at home instead of abroad, and curb his
propensity to censoriousness, he would not be so keen to detect
evil in others, for he would see that he stood in need of much
allowance himself. But now each of us, when angry and punishing,
quote the words of Aristides and Cato, "Do not steal, Do not tell
lies," and "Why are you lazy?" And, what is most disgraceful of
all, we blame angry people when we are angry ourselves, and
chastise in temper faults that were committed in temper, unlike the
doctors who</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"With bitter physic purge the
bitter bile,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>for we rather increase and aggravate the disease. Whenever then
I busy myself with such considerations as these, I try also to
curtail my curiosity. For to scrutinize and pry into everything too
minutely, and to overhaul every business of a servant, or action of
a friend, or pastime of a son, or whisper of a wife, produces
frequent, indeed daily, fits of anger, caused entirely by
peevishness and harshness of character. Euripides says that the
Deity</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"In great things intervenes,
but small things leaves</span> <span class="i0">To fortune;"<a
name="FNanchor_707_707" id="FNanchor_707_707"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_707_707" class="fnanchor">707</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>but I am of opinion that a prudent man should commit nothing to
fortune, nor neglect anything, but should put some things in his
wife's hands to manage, others in the <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>hands of his servants,
others in the hands of his friends, (as a governor has his
stewards, and financiers, and controllers), while he himself
superintends the most important and weighty matters. For as small
writing strains the eyes, so small matters even more strain and
bother people, and stir up their anger, which carries this evil
habit to greater matters. Above all I thought that saying of
Empedocles, "Fast from evil,"<a name="FNanchor_708_708" id=
"FNanchor_708_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_708" class=
"fnanchor">708</a> a great and divine one, and I approved of those
promises and vows as not ungraceful or unphilosophical, to abstain
for a year from wine and Venus, honouring the deity by continence,
or for a stated time to give up lying, taking great heed to
ourselves to be truthful always whether in play or earnest. With
these I compared my own vow, as no less pleasing to the gods and
holy, first to abstain from anger for a few days, like spending
days without drunkenness or even without wine at all, offering as
it were wineless offerings of honey.<a name="FNanchor_709_709" id=
"FNanchor_709_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_709" class=
"fnanchor">709</a> Then I tried for a month or two, and so in time
made some progress in forbearance by earnest resolve, and by
keeping myself courteous and without anger and using fair language,
purifying myself from evil words and absurd actions, and from
passion which for a little unlovely pleasure pays us with great
mental disturbance and the bitterest repentance. In consequence of
all this my experience, and the assistance of the deity, has made
me form the view, that courtesy and gentleness and kindliness are
not so agreeable, and pleasant, and delightful, to any of those we
live with as to ourselves, that have those qualities.<a name=

<h3>ON CONTENTEDNESS OF MIND.<a name="FNanchor_711_711" id=
"FNanchor_711_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_711" class=
"fnanchor">711</a></h3>

<h4>PLUTARCH SENDS GREETING TO PACCIUS.</h4>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> It was late when I received
your letter, asking me to write to you something on contentedness
of mind, and on those things in the Tim&aelig;us that require an
accurate explanation. And it so fell out that at that very time our
friend Eros was obliged to set sail at once for Rome, having
received a letter from the excellent Fundanus, urging haste
according to his wont. And not having as much time as I could have
wished to meet your request, and yet not thinking for one moment of
letting my messenger go to you entirely empty-handed, I copied out
the notes that I had chanced to make on contentedness of mind. For
I thought that you did not desire this discourse merely to be
treated to a subject handled in fine style, but for the real
business of life. And I congratulate you that, though you have
friendships with princes, and have as much forensic reputation as
anybody, yet you are not in the same plight as the tragic Merops,
nor have you like him by the felicitations of the multitude been
induced to forget the sufferings of humanity; but you remember,
what you have often heard, that a patrician's slipper<a name=
"FNanchor_712_712" id="FNanchor_712_712"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_712_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> is no cure for the
gout, nor a costly ring for a whitlow, nor a diadem for the
headache. For how can riches, or fame, or power at court help us to
ease of mind or a calm life, unless we enjoy them when present, but
are not for ever pining after them when absent? And what else
causes this but the long exercise and practice of reason, which,
when the unreasoning and emotional part of the soul breaks out of
bounds, curbs it quickly, and does not allow it to be carried away
headlong from its actual position? And as Xenophon<a name=
"FNanchor_713_713" id="FNanchor_713_713"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_713_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> advised that we should
remember and honour the gods most especially in prosperity, that
so, when we should be in any strait, we might confidently call upon
them as already our well-wishers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290"
id="Page_290">290</a></span> and friends; so sensible men
would do well before trouble comes to meditate on remedies how to
bear it, that they may be the more efficacious from being ready for
use long before. For as savage dogs are excited at every sound, and
are only soothed by a familiar voice, so also it is not easy to
quiet the wild passions of the soul, unless familiar and well-known
arguments be at hand to check its excitement.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> He then that said, that
the man that wished to have an easy mind ought to have little to do
either public or private, first of all makes ease of mind a very
costly article for us, if it is to be bought at the price of doing
nothing, as if he should advise every sick person,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Lie still, poor wretch, in

<p>And indeed stupor is a bad remedy for the body against
despair,<a name="FNanchor_715_715" id="FNanchor_715_715"></a><a
href="#Footnote_715_715" class="fnanchor">715</a> nor is he any
better physician of the soul who removes its trouble and anxiety by
recommending a lazy and soft life and a leaving our friends and
relations and country in the lurch. In the next place, it is false
that those that have little to do are easy in mind. For then women
would be easier in mind than men, since they mostly stay at home in
inactivity, and even now-a-days it is as Hesiod says,<a name=

<p>yet griefs and troubles and unrest, proceeding from jealousy or
superstition or ambition or vanity, inundate the women's part of
the house with unceasing flow. And Laertes, though he lived for
twenty years a solitary life in the country,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"With an old woman to attend

</div>

<p>and fled from his country and house and kingdom, yet had sorrow
and dejection<a name="FNanchor_718_718" id=
"FNanchor_718_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_718" class=
"fnanchor">718</a> as a perpetual companion with leisure. And some
have been often thrown into sad unrest merely from inaction, as the
following,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"But fleet Achilles,

<p>And full of emotion and distress at this state of things he
himself says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"A useless burden to the earth

"#Footnote_720_720" class="fnanchor">720</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>So even Epicurus thinks that those who are desirous of honour
and glory should not rust in inglorious ease, but use their natural
talents in public life for the benefit of the community at large,
seeing that they are by nature so constituted that they would be
more likely to be troubled and afflicted at inaction, if they did
not get what they desired. But he is absurd in that he does not
urge men of ability to take part in public life, but only the
restless. But we ought not to estimate ease or unrest of mind by
our many or few actions, but by their fairness or foulness. For the
omission of fair actions troubles and distresses us, as I have said
before, quite as much as the actual doing of foul actions.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> As for those who think
that one kind of life is especially free from trouble, as some
think that of farmers, others that of bachelors, others that of
kings, Menander sufficiently exposes their error in the following
lines:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Phania, I thought those rich
who need not borrow,</span> <span class="i0">Nor groan at nights,
nor cry out 'Woe is me,'</span> <span class="i0">Kicked up and down
in this untoward world,</span> <span class="i0">But sweet and
gentle sleep they may enjoy."</span></div>
</div>

<p>He then goes on to remark that he saw the rich suffering the
same as the poor,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Trouble and life are truly
near akin.</span> <span class="i0">With the luxurious or the
glorious life</span> <span class="i0">Trouble consorts, and in the
life of poverty</span> <span class="i0">Lasts with it to the
end."</span></div>
</div>

<p>But just as people on the sea, timid and prone to sea-sickness,
think they will suffer from it less on board a merchantman than on
a boat, and for the same reason shift their quarters to a trireme,
but do not attain anything by these changes, for they take with
them their timidity and qualmishness, so changes of life do not
remove the sorrows and troubles <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>of the soul; which proceed
from want of experience and reflection, and from inability or
ignorance rightly to enjoy the present. These afflict the rich as
well as the poor; these trouble the married as well as the
unmarried; these make people shun the forum, but find no happiness
in retirement; these make people eagerly desire introductions at
court, though when got they straightway care no more about
them.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"The sick are peevish in their
straits and needs."<a name="FNanchor_721_721" id=

</div>

<p>For the wife bothers them, and they grumble at the doctor, and
they find the bed uneasy, and, as Ion says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"The friend that visits them
tires their patience,</span> <span class="i0">And yet they do not
like him to depart."</span></div>
</div>

<p>But afterwards, when the illness is over, and a sounder
condition supervenes, health returns and makes all things pleasant
and acceptable. He that yesterday loathed eggs and cakes of finest
meal and purest bread will to-day eat eagerly and with appetite
coarsest bread with a few olives and cress.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Such contentedness and
change of view in regard to every kind of life does the infusion of
reason bring about. When Alexander heard from Anaxarchus of the
infinite number of worlds, he wept, and when his friends asked him
what was the matter, he replied, "Is it not a matter for tears
that, when the number of worlds is infinite, I have not conquered
one?" But Crates, who had only a wallet and threadbare cloak,
passed all his life jesting and laughing as if at a festival.
Agamemnon was troubled with his rule over so many subjects,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"You look on Agamemnon,
Atreus' son,</span> <span class="i0">Whom Zeus has plunged for ever
in a mass</span> <span class="i0">Of never-ending cares."<a name=
"FNanchor_722_722" id="FNanchor_722_722"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_722_722" class="fnanchor">722</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>But Diogenes when he was being sold sat down and kept jeering at
the auctioneer, and would not stand up when he bade him, but said
joking and laughing, "Would you tell a fish you were selling to
stand up?" And Socrates in prison played the philosopher and
discoursed with his <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id=
"Page_293">293</a></span>friends. But Ph&auml;ethon,<a name=
"FNanchor_723_723" id="FNanchor_723_723"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_723_723" class="fnanchor">723</a> when he got up to
heaven, wept because nobody gave to him his father's horses and
chariot. As therefore the shoe is shaped by the foot, and not the
foot by the shoe, so does the disposition make the life similar to
itself. For it is not, as one said, custom that makes the best life
seem sweet to those that choose it, but it is sense that makes that
very life at once the best and sweetest. Let us cleanse therefore
the fountain of contentedness, which is within us, that so external
things may turn out for our good, through our putting the best face
on them.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Events will take their
course, it is no good</span> <span class="i0">Our being angry at
them, he is happiest</span> <span class="i0">Who wisely turns them
to the best account."<a name="FNanchor_724_724" id=

</div>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> Plato compared human life
to a game at dice, wherein we ought to throw according to our
requirements, and, having thrown, to make the best use of whatever
turns up. It is not in our power indeed to determine what the throw
will be, but it is our part, if we are wise, to accept in a right
spirit whatever fortune sends, and so to contrive matters that what
we wish should do us most good, and what we do not wish should do
us least harm. For those who live at random and without judgement,
like those sickly people who can stand neither heat nor cold, are
unduly elated by prosperity, and cast down by adversity; and in
either case suffer from unrest, but 'tis their own fault, and
perhaps they suffer most in what are called good circumstances.
Theodorus, who was surnamed the Atheist, used to say that he held
out arguments with his right hand, but his hearers received them
with their left; so awkward people frequently take in a clumsy
manner the favours of fortune; but men of sense, as bees extract
honey from thyme which is the strongest and driest of herbs,<a
name="FNanchor_725_725" id="FNanchor_725_725"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_725_725" class="fnanchor">725</a> so from the least
auspicious circumstances frequently derive advantage and
profit.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> We ought then to cultivate
such a habit as this, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id=
"Page_294">294</a></span>like the man who threw a stone at his dog,
and missed it, but hit his step-mother, and cried out, "Not so
bad." Thus we may often turn the edge of fortune when things turn
not out as we wish. Diogenes was driven into exile; "not so bad;"
for his exile made him turn philosopher. And Zeno of Cittium,<a
name="FNanchor_726_726" id="FNanchor_726_726"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_726_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> when he heard that the
only merchantman he had was wrecked, cargo and all, said, "Fortune,
you treat me handsomely, since you reduce me to my threadbare cloak
and piazza."<a name="FNanchor_727_727" id="FNanchor_727_727"></a><a
href="#Footnote_727_727" class="fnanchor">727</a> What prevents our
imitating such men as these? Have you failed to get some office?
You will be able to live in the country henceforth, and manage your
own affairs. Did you court the friendship of some great man, and
meet with a rebuff? You will live free from danger and cares. Have
you again had matters to deal with that required labour and
thought? "Warm water will not so much make the limbs soft by
soaking," to quote Pindar,<a name="FNanchor_728_728" id=
"FNanchor_728_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_728" class=
"fnanchor">728</a> as glory and honour and power make "labour
sweet, and toil to be no toil."<a name="FNanchor_729_729" id=
"FNanchor_729_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_729" class=
"fnanchor">729</a> Or has any bad luck or contumely fallen on you
in consequence of some calumny or from envy? The breeze is
favourable that will waft you to the Muses and the Academy, as it
did Plato when his friendship with Dionysius came to an end. It
does indeed greatly conduce to contentedness of mind to see how
famous men have borne the same troubles with an unruffled mind. For
example, does childlessness trouble you? Consider those kings of
the Romans, none of whom left his kingdom to a son. Are you
distressed at the pinch of poverty? Who of the B&oelig;otians would
you rather prefer to be than Epaminondas, or of the Romans than
Fabricius? Has your wife been seduced? Have you never read that
inscription at Delphi,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Agis the king of land and sea
erected me;"</span></div>
</div>

<p>and have you not heard that his wife Tim&aelig;a was seduced by
Alcibiades, and in her whispers to her handmaidens called the child
that was born Alcibiades? Yet this did not prevent Agis from being
the most famous and greatest <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>of the Greeks. Neither again
did the licentiousness of his daughter prevent Stilpo from leading
the merriest life of all the philosophers that were his
contemporaries. And when Metrocles reproached him with her life, he
said, "Is it my fault or hers?" And when Metrocles answered, "Her
fault, but your misfortune," he rejoined, "How say you? Are not
faults also slips?" "Certainly," said he. "And are not slips
mischances in those matters wherein we slip?" Metrocles assented.
"And are not mischances misfortunes in those matters wherein we
mischance?" By this gentle and philosophical argument he
demonstrated the Cynic's reproach to be an idle bark.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> But most people are
troubled and exasperated not only at the bad in their friends and
intimates, but also in their enemies. For railing and anger and
envy and malignity and jealousy and ill-will are the bane of those
that suffer from those infirmities, and trouble and exasperate the
foolish: as for example the quarrels of neighbours, and peevishness
of acquaintances, and the want of ability in those that manage
state affairs. By these things you yourself seem to me to be put
out not a little, as the doctors in Sophocles, who</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"With bitter physic purge the
bitter bile,"<a name="FNanchor_730_730" id=
"FNanchor_730_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_730" class=
"fnanchor">730</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>so vexed and bitter are you at people's weaknesses and
infirmities, which is not reasonable in you. Even your own private
affairs are not always managed by simple and good and suitable
instruments, so to speak, but very frequently by sharp and crooked
ones. Do not think it then either your business, or an easy matter
either, to set all these things to rights. But if you take people
as they are, as the surgeon uses his bandages and instruments for
drawing teeth, and with cheerfulness and serenity welcome all that
happens, as you would look upon barking dogs as only following
their nature, you will be happier in the disposition you will then
have than you will be distressed at other people's disagreeableness
and shortcomings. For you will forget to make a collection of
disagreeable things,<a name="FNanchor_731_731" id=
"FNanchor_731_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_731" class=
"fnanchor">731</a> which <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296"
id="Page_296">296</a></span>now inundate, as some hollow and
low-lying ground, your littleness of mind and weakness, which fills
itself with other people's bad points. For seeing that some of the
philosophers censure compassion to the unfortunate (on the ground
that it is good to help our neighbours, and not to give way to
sentimental sympathy in connection with them), and, what is of more
importance, do not allow those that are conscious of their errors
and bad moral disposition to be dejected and grieved at them, but
bid them cure their defects without grief at once, is it not
altogether unreasonable, look you, to allow ourselves to be peevish
and vexed, because all those who have dealings with us and come
near us are not good and clever? Let us see to it, dear Paccius,
that we do not, whether we are aware of it or not, play a part,
really looking<a name="FNanchor_732_732" id=
"FNanchor_732_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_732" class=
"fnanchor">732</a> not at the universal defects of those that
approach us, but at our own interests through our selfishness, and
not through our hatred of evil. For excessive excitement about
things, and an undue appetite and desire for them, or on the other
hand aversion and dislike to them, engender suspiciousness and
peevishness against persons, who were, we think, the cause of our
being deprived of some things, and of being troubled with others.
But he that is accustomed to adapt himself to things easily and
calmly is most cheerful and gentle in his dealings with people.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> Wherefore let us resume
our argument. As in a fever everything seems bitter and unpleasant
to the taste, but when we see others not loathing but fancying the
very same eatables and drinkables, we no longer find the fault to
be in them but in ourselves and our disease, so we shall cease to
blame and be discontented with the state of affairs, if we see
others cheerfully and without grief enduring the same. It also
makes for contentedness, when things happen against our wish, not
to overlook our many advantages and comforts, but by looking at
both good and bad to feel that the good preponderate. When our eyes
are dazzled with things too bright we turn them away, and ease them
by looking at flowers or grass, while we keep the eyes of our mind
strained on disagreeable things, and force <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>them to dwell on bitter
ideas, well-nigh tearing them away by force from the consideration
of pleasanter things. And yet one might apply here, not unaptly,
what was said to the man of curiosity,<a name="FNanchor_733_733"
id="FNanchor_733_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_733" class=

<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Malignant wretch, why art so
keen to mark</span> <span class="i0">Thy neighbour's fault, and
seest not thine own?"</span></div>
</div>

<p>Why on earth, my good sir, do you confine your view to your
troubles, making them so vivid and acute, while you do not let your
mind dwell at all on your present comforts? But as cupping-glasses
draw the worst blood from the flesh, so you force upon your
attention the worst things in your lot: acting not a whit more
wisely than that Chian, who, selling much choice wine to others,
asked for some sour wine for his own supper; and one of his slaves
being asked by another, what he had left his master doing, replied,
"Asking for bad when good was by." For most people overlook the
advantages and pleasures of their individual lives, and run to
their difficulties and grievances. Aristippus, however, was not
such a one, for he cleverly knew as in a scale to make the better
preponderate over the worse. So having lost a good farm, he asked
one of those who made a great show of condolence and sympathy,
"Have you not only one little piece of ground, while I have three
fields left?" And when he admitted that it was so, he went on to
say, "Ought I not then to condole with you rather than you with
me?" For it is the act of a madman to distress oneself over what is
lost, and not to rejoice at what is left; but like little children,
if one of their many playthings be taken away by anyone, throw the
rest away and weep and cry out, so we, if we are assailed by
fortune in some one point, wail and mourn and make all other things
seem unprofitable in our eyes.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> Suppose someone should
say, What blessings have we? I would reply, What have we not? One
has reputation, another a house, another a wife, another a good
friend. When Antipater of Tarsus was reckoning up on his death-bed
his various pieces of good fortune, he did not <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>even pass
over his favourable voyage from Cilicia to Athens. So we should not
overlook, but take account of everyday blessings, and rejoice
that we live, and are well, and see the sun, and that no war or
sedition plagues our country, but that the earth is open to
cultivation, the sea secure to mariners, and that we can speak or
be silent, lead a busy or an idle life, as we choose. We shall get
more contentedness from the presence of all these blessings, if we
fancy them as absent, and remember from time to time how people ill
yearn for health, and people in war for peace, and strangers and
unknown in a great city for reputation and friends, and how painful
it is to be deprived of all these when one has once had them. For
then each of these blessings will not appear to us only great and
valuable when it is lost, and of no value while we have it. For not
having it cannot add value to anything. Nor ought we to amass
things we regard as valuable, and always be on the tremble and
afraid of losing them as valuable things, and yet, when we have
them, ignore them and think little of them; but we ought to use
them for our pleasure and enjoyment, that we may bear their loss,
if that should happen, with more equanimity. But most people, as
Arcesilaus said, think it right to inspect minutely and in every
detail, perusing them alike with the eyes of the body and mind,
other people's poems and paintings and statues, while they neglect
to study their own lives, which have often many not unpleasing
subjects for contemplation, looking abroad and ever admiring other
people's reputations and fortunes, as adulterers admire other men's
wives, and think cheap of their own.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> And yet it makes much for
contentedness of mind to look for the most part at home and to our
own condition, or if not, to look at the case of people worse off
than ourselves, and not, as most people do, to compare ourselves
with those who are better off. For example, those who are in chains
think those happy who are freed from their chains, and they again
freemen, and freemen citizens, and they again the rich, and the
rich satraps, and satraps kings, and kings the gods, content with
hardly anything short of hurling thunderbolts and lightning. And so
they ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id=
"Page_299">299</a></span> want something above them, and are never
thankful for what they have.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I care not for the wealth of
golden Gyges,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>and,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I never had or envy or
desire</span> <span class="i0">To be a god, or love for mighty
empire,</span> <span class="i0">Far distant from my eyes are all
such things."</span></div>
</div>

<p>But this, you will say, was the language of a Thasian. But you
will find others, Chians or Galatians or Bithynians, not content
with the share of glory or power they have among their
fellow-citizens, but weeping because they do not wear senators'
shoes; or, if they have them, that they cannot be pr&aelig;tors at
Rome; or, if they get that office, that they are not consuls; or,
if they are consuls, that they are only proclaimed second and not
first. What is all this but seeking out excuses for being
unthankful to fortune, only to torment and punish oneself? But he
that has a mind in sound condition, does not sit down in sorrow and
dejection if he is less renowned or rich than some of the countless
myriads of mankind that the sun looks upon, "who feed on the
produce of the wide world,"<a name="FNanchor_734_734" id=
"FNanchor_734_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_734" class=
"fnanchor">734</a> but goes on his way rejoicing at his fortune and
life, as far fairer and happier than that of myriads of others. In
the Olympian games it is not possible to be the victor by choosing
one's competitors. But in the race of life circumstances allow us
to plume ourselves on surpassing many, and to be objects of envy
rather than to have to envy others, unless we pit ourselves against
a Briareus or a Hercules. Whenever then you admire anyone carried
by in his litter as a greater man than yourself, lower your eyes
and look at those that bear the litter. And when you think the
famous Xerxes happy for his passage over the Hellespont, as a
native of those parts<a name="FNanchor_735_735" id=
"FNanchor_735_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_735" class=
"fnanchor">735</a> did, look too at those who dug through Mount
Athos under the lash, and at those whose ears and noses were cut
off because the bridge was broken by the waves, consider their
state of mind also, for they think your life and fortunes happy.
Socrates, when he heard one of his friends saying, "How <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>dear
this city is! Chian wine costs one mina,<a name="FNanchor_736_736"

five drachm&aelig;," took him to the meal market, and showed him
half a peck of meal for an obol, then took him to the olive market,
and showed him a peck of olives for two coppers, and lastly showed
him that a sleeveless vest<a name="FNanchor_737_737" id=

"fnanchor">737</a> was only ten drachm&aelig;. At each place
Socrates' friend exclaimed, "How cheap this city is!" So also we,
when we hear anyone saying that our affairs are bad and in a woful
plight, because we are not consuls or governors, may reply, "Our
affairs are in an admirable condition, and our life an enviable
one, seeing that we do not beg, nor carry burdens, nor live by
flattery."</p>

<p><a name="Page_300a" id="Page_300a" />&sect; <span class=

live more with an eye to others than ourselves, and since nature is
so jealous and envious that it rejoices not so much in its own
blessings as it is pained by those of others, do not look only at
the much-cried-up splendour of those whom you envy and admire, but
open and draw, as it were, the gaudy curtain of their pomp and
show, and peep within, you will see that they have much to trouble
them, and many things to annoy them. The well-known Pittacus,<a

"#Footnote_738_738" class="fnanchor">738</a> whose fame was so
great for fortitude and wisdom and uprightness, was once
entertaining some guests, and his wife came in in a rage and upset
the table, and as the guests were dismayed he said, Every one of
you has some trouble, and he who has mine only is not so bad

<p>By such reflections as these one may wean oneself from that
discontent with one's fortune, which makes one's own condition look
low and mean from too much admiring one's neighbour's.</p>

<p><a name="Page_301a" id="Page_301a" />&sect; <span class=
"smcap">xii.</span> Another thing, which is a great hindrance to
peace of mind, is not to proportion our desires to our means, but
to carry too much sail, as it were, in our hopes of great things
and then, if unsuccessful, to blame destiny and fortune, and not
our own folly. For he is not unfortunate who wishes to shoot with a
plough, or hunt the hare with an ox; nor has he an evil genius
opposed to him, who does not catch deer with fishing nets, but
merely is the dupe of his own stupidity and folly in attempting
impossibilities. Self-love is mainly to blame, making people fond
of being first and aspiring in all matters, and insatiably desirous
to engage in everything. For people not only wish at one and the
same time to be rich, and learned, and strong, and boon-companions,
and agreeable, and friends of kings, and governors of cities, but
they are also discontented if they have not dogs and horses and
quails and cocks of the first quality. Dionysius the elder was not
content with being the most powerful monarch of his times, but
because he could not beat Philoxenus the poet in singing, or
surpass Plato in dialectics, was so angry and exasperated that he
put the one to work in his stone quarries, and sent the other to
&AElig;gina and sold him there. Alexander was of a different
spirit, for when Crisso the famous runner ran a race with him, and
seemed to let the king outrun him on purpose, he was greatly
displeased. Good also was the spirit of Achilles in Homer, who,
when he said,</p>

<p>And when Megabyzus the Persian visited the studio of Apelles,
and began to chatter about art, Apelles stopped him and said,
"While you kept silence you seemed to be somebody from your gold
and purple, but now these lads that are grinding colours are
laughing at your nonsense." But some who think the Stoics only talk
idly, in styling their wise man not only prudent and just and brave
but also orator and general and poet and rich man and king, yet
claim for themselves all those titles, and are indignant if they do
not get them. And yet even among the gods different functions are
assigned to different personages; thus one is called the god of
war, another the god of oracles, another the god of gain, and
Aphrodite, as she has nothing to do with warlike affairs, is
despatched by Zeus to marriages and bridals.</p>

<p><a name="Page_302a" id="Page_302a" />&sect; <span class=
"smcap">xiii.</span> And indeed there are some pursuits which
cannot exist together, but are by their very nature opposed. For
example oratory and the study of the mathematics require ease and
leisure; whereas political ability and the friendship of kings
cannot be attained without mixing in affairs and in public life.
Moreover wine and indulgence in meat make the body indeed strong
and vigorous, but blunt the intellect; and though unremitting
attention to making and saving money will heap up wealth, yet
despising and contemning riches is a great help to philosophy. So
that all things are not within any one's power, and we must obey
that saying inscribed in the temple of Apollo at Delphi, <i>Know
thyself</i>,<a name="FNanchor_743_743" id="FNanchor_743_743"></a><a
href="#Footnote_743_743" class="fnanchor">743</a> and adapt
ourselves to our natural bent, and not drag and force nature to
some other kind of life or pursuit. "The horse to the chariot, and
the ox to the plough, and swiftly alongside the ship scuds the
dolphin, while he that meditates destruction for the boar must find
a staunch hound."<a name="FNanchor_744_744" id=

rich widow, is out of his senses. And not a whit wiser is he who
wishes to be an Empedocles, or Plato, or Democritus, and write
about the world and the real nature of things, and at the same time
to be married like Euphorion to a rich wife, or to revel and drink
with Alexander like Medius; and is grieved and vexed if he is not
also admired for his wealth like Ismenias, and for his virtue like
Epaminondas. But runners are not discontented because they do not
carry off the crowns of wrestlers, but rejoice and delight in their
own crowns. "You are a citizen of Sparta: see you make the most of
her." So too said Solon:</p>

<p>And Strato the natural philosopher, when he heard that Menedemus
had many more pupils than he had, said, "Is it wonderful at all
that more wish to wash than to be anointed?" And Aristotle, writing
to Antipater, said, "Not only has Alexander a right to plume
himself on his rule over many subjects, but no less legitimate is
satisfaction at entertaining right opinions about the gods." For
those that think so highly of their own walk in life will not be so
envious about their neighbours'. We do not expect a vine to bear
figs, nor an olive grapes, yet now-a-days, with regard to
ourselves, if we have not at one and the same time the privilege of
being accounted rich and learned, generals and philosophers,
flatterers and outspoken, stingy and extravagant, we slander
ourselves and are dissatisfied, and despise ourselves as living a
maimed and imperfect life. Furthermore, we see that nature teaches
us the same lesson.<a name="FNanchor_747_747" id=

<p>For not only do people envy those of the same trade and manner
of life, but the rich envy the learned, and the famous the rich,

the attendants at kings' courts, and by all this envy give
themselves no small trouble and annoyance.</p>

himself the magazines of content or discontent, and that the jars
containing blessings and evils are not on the threshold of Zeus,<a

"#Footnote_750_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> but lie stored in the
mind, is plain from the differences of men's passions. For the
foolish overlook and neglect present blessings, through their
thoughts being ever intent on the future; but the wise make the
past clearly present to them through memory. For the present giving
only a moment of time to the touch, and then evading our grasp,
does not seem to the foolish to be ours or to belong to us at all.
And like that person<a name="FNanchor_751_751" id=

"fnanchor">751</a> painted as rope-making in Hades and permitting
an ass feeding by to eat up the rope as fast as he makes it, so the
stupid and thankless forgetfulness of most people comes upon them
and takes possession of them, and obliterates from their mind every
past action, whether success, or pleasant leisure, or society, or
enjoyment, and breaks the unity of life which arises from the past
being blended with the present; for detaching to-day from both
yesterday and to-morrow, it soon makes every event as if it had
never happened from lack of memory. For as those in the schools,
who deny the growth of our bodies by reason of the continual flux
of substance, make each of us in theory different from himself and
another man, so those who do not keep or recall to their memory
former things, but let them drift, actually empty them<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>selves
daily, and hang upon the morrow, as if what happened a year ago, or
even yesterday and the day before yesterday, had nothing to do with
them, and had hardly occurred at all.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> This is one great
hindrance to contentedness of mind, and another still greater is
whenever, like flies that slide down smooth places in mirrors, but
stick fast in rough places or where there are cracks, men let
pleasant and agreeable things glide from their memory, and pin
themselves down to the remembrance of unpleasant things; or rather,
as at Olynthus they say beetles, when they get into a certain place
called Destruction-to-beetles, cannot get out, but fly round and
round till they die, so men will glide into the remembrance of
their woes, and will not give themselves a respite from sorrow.
But, as we use our brightest colours in a picture, so in the mind
we ought to look at the cheerful and bright side of things, and
hide and keep down the gloomy, for we cannot altogether obliterate
or get rid of it. For, as the strings of the bow and lyre are
alternately tightened and relaxed, so is it with the order of the
world; in human affairs there is nothing pure and without alloy.
But as in music there are high and low notes, and in grammar vowels
and mutes, but neither the musician nor grammarian decline to use
either kinds, but know how to blend and employ them both for their
purpose, so in human affairs which are balanced one against
another,&mdash;for, as Euripides says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"There is no good without ill
in the world,</span> <span class="i0">But everything is mixed in
due proportion,"&mdash;</span></div>
</div>

<p>we ought not to be disheartened or despondent; but as musicians
drown their worst music with the best, so should we take good and
bad together, and make our chequered life one of convenience and
harmony. For it is not, as Menander says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Directly any man is born, a
genius</span> <span class="i0">Befriends him, a good guide to him
for life,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>but it is rather, as Empedocles states, two fates or genii take
hold of each of us when we are born and govern us. "There were
Chthonia and far-seeing Heliope, and cruel Deris, and grave
Harmonia, and Callisto, and &AElig;schra, and<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span> Thoosa,
and Den&aelig;a, and charming Nemertes, and Asaphea with the black
fruit."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> And as<a name=
"FNanchor_752_752" id="FNanchor_752_752"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_752_752" class="fnanchor">752</a> at our birth we
received the mingled seeds of each of these passions, which is the
cause of much irregularity, the sensible person hopes for better
things, but expects worse, and makes the most of either,
remembering that wise maxim, <i>Not too much of anything.</i> For
not only will he who is least solicitous about to-morrow best enjoy
it when it comes, as Epicurus says, but also wealth, and renown,
and power and rule, gladden most of all the hearts of those who are
least afraid of the contrary. For the immoderate desire for each,
implanting a most immoderate fear of losing them, makes the
enjoyment of them weak and wavering, like a flame under the
influence of a wind. But he whom reason enables to say to fortune
without fear or trembling,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"If you bring any good I
gladly welcome it,</span> <span class="i0">But if you fail me
little does it trouble me,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>he can enjoy the present with most zest through his confidence,
and absence of fear of the loss of what he has, which would be
unbearable. For we may not only admire but also imitate the
behaviour of Anaxagoras, which made him cry out at the death of his
son, "I knew I had begot a mortal," and apply it to every
contingency. For example, "I know that wealth is ephemeral and
insecure; I know that those who gave power can take it away again;
I know that my wife is good, but still a woman; and that my friend,
since a human being, is by nature a changeable animal, to use
Plato's expression." For such a prepared frame of mind, if anything
happens unwished for but not unexpected, not admitting of such
phrases as "I shouldn't have dreamed of it," or "I expected quite a
different lot," or "I didn't look for this," abates the violent<a
name="FNanchor_753_753" id="FNanchor_753_753"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_753_753" class="fnanchor">753</a> beatings and
palpitations of the heart, and quickly causes wild unrest to
subside. Carneades indeed reminds us that in great matters the
unexpected makes the sum total of grief and dejection. Certainly
the kingdom of Macedonia was many times smaller than the Roman
Empire, but when <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id=
"Page_307">307</a></span>Perseus lost Macedonia, he not only
himself bewailed his wretched fate, but seemed to all men the most
unfortunate and unlucky of mankind; yet &AElig;milius who conquered
him, though he had to give up to another the command both by land
and sea, yet was crowned, and offered sacrifice, and was justly
esteemed happy. For he knew that he had taken a command which he
would have to give up, but Perseus lost his kingdom without
expecting it. Well also has the poet<a name="FNanchor_754_754" id=
"FNanchor_754_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_754" class=
"fnanchor">754</a> shown the power of anything that happens
unexpectedly. For Odysseus wept bitterly at the death of his dog,
but was not so moved when he sat by his wife who wept, for in the
latter case he had come fully determined to keep his emotion under
the control of reason, whereas in the former it was against his
expectation, and therefore fell upon him as a sudden blow.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvii.</span> And since generally
speaking some things which happen against our will pain and trouble
us by their very nature, while in the case of most we accustom
ourselves and learn to be disgusted with them from fancy, it is not
unprofitable to counteract this to have ever ready that line of
Menander,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"You suffer no dread thing but
in your fancy."</span></div>
</div>

<p>For what, if they touch you neither in soul nor body, are such
things to you as the low birth of your father, or the adultery of
your wife, or the loss of some prize or precedence, since even by
their absence a man is not prevented from being in excellent
condition both of body and soul. And with respect to the things
that seem to pain us by their very nature, as sickness, and
anxieties, and the deaths of friends and children, we should
remember, that line of Euripides,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Alas! and why alas? we only
suffer</span> <span class="i0">What mortals must
expect."</span></div>
</div>

<p>For no argument has so much weight with emotion when it is borne
down with grief, as that which reminds it of the common and natural
necessity to which man is exposed owing to the body, the only
handle which he gives to fortune, for in his most important and
influential part<a name="FNanchor_755_755" id=
"FNanchor_755_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_755" class=
"fnanchor">755</a> he is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308"
id="Page_308">308</a></span>secure against external things. When
Demetrius captured Megara, he asked Stilpo if any of his things had
been plundered, and Stilpo answered, "I saw nobody carrying off
anything of mine."<a name="FNanchor_756_756" id=
"FNanchor_756_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_756" class=
"fnanchor">756</a> And so when fortune has plundered us and
stripped us of everything else, we have that within ourselves</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Which the Ach&aelig;ans ne'er
could rob us of."<a name="FNanchor_757_757" id=
"FNanchor_757_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_757" class=
"fnanchor">757</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>So that we ought not altogether to abase and lower nature, as if
she had no strength or stability against fortune; but on the
contrary, knowing that the rotten and perishable part of man,
wherein alone he lies open to fortune, is small, while we ourselves
are masters of the better part, wherein are situated our greatest
blessings, as good opinions and teaching and virtuous precepts, all
which things cannot be abstracted from us or perish, we ought to
look on the future with invincible courage, and say to fortune, as
Socrates is supposed to have said to his accusers Anytus and
Melitus before the jury, "Anytus and Melitus can kill me, but they
cannot hurt me." For fortune can afflict us with disease, take away
our money, calumniate us to the people or king, but cannot make a
good and brave and high-souled man bad and cowardly and low and
ignoble and envious, nor take away that disposition of mind, whose
constant presence is of more use for the conduct of life than the
presence of a pilot at sea. For the pilot cannot make calm the wild
wave or wind, nor can he find a haven at his need wherever he
wishes, nor can he await his fate with confidence and without
trembling, but as long as he has not despaired, but uses his skill,
he scuds before the gale, "lowering his big sail, till his lower
mast is only just above the sea dark as Erebus," and sits at the
helm trembling and quaking. But the disposition of a wise man gives
calm even to the body, mostly cutting off the causes of diseases by
temperance and plain living and moderate exercise; but if some
beginning of trouble arise from without, as we avoid a sunken rock,
so he passes by it with furled sail, as Asclepiades puts it; but if
some unexpected <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id=
"Page_309">309</a></span> and tremendous gale come upon him and
prove too much for him, the harbour is at hand, and he can swim
away from the body, as from a leaky boat.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xviii.</span> For it is the fear of
death, and not the desire of life, that makes the foolish person to
hang to the body, clinging to it, as Odysseus did to the fig-tree
from fear of Charybdis that lay below,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Where the wind neither let
him stay, or sail,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>so that he was displeased at this, and afraid of that. But he
who understands somehow or other the nature of the soul, and
reflects that the change it will undergo at death will be either to
something better or at least not worse, he has in his fearlessness
of death no small help to ease of mind in life. For to one who can
enjoy life when virtue and what is congenial to him have the upper
hand, and that can fearlessly depart from life, when uncongenial
and unnatural things are in the ascendant, with the words on his
lips,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"The deity shall free me, when
I will,"<a name="FNanchor_758_758" id="FNanchor_758_758"></a><a
href="#Footnote_758_758" class="fnanchor">758</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>what can we imagine could befall such a man as this that would
vex him and wear him and harass him? For he who said, "I have
anticipated you, O fortune, and cut off all your loopholes to get
at me," did not trust to bolts or keys or walls, but to
determination and reason, which are within the power of all persons
that choose. And we ought not to despair or disbelieve any of these
sayings, but admiring them and emulating them and being
enthusiastic about them, we ought to try and test ourselves in
smaller matters with a view to greater, not avoiding or rejecting
that self-examination, nor sheltering ourselves under the remark,
"Perhaps nothing will be more difficult." For inertia<a name=
"FNanchor_759_759" id="FNanchor_759_759"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_759_759" class="fnanchor">759</a> and softness are
generated by that self-indulgence which ever occupies itself only
with the easiest tasks, and flees from the disagreeable to what is
most pleasant. But the soul that accustoms itself to face steadily
sickness and grief and exile, and calls in reason to its help in
each case, will find in what appears so sore and <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>dreadful
much that is false, empty, and rotten, as reason will show in each
case.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xix.</span> And yet many shudder at
that line of Menander,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"No one can say, I shall not
suffer this or that,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>being ignorant how much it helps us to freedom from grief to
practise to be able to look fortune in the face with our eyes open,
and not to entertain fine and soft fancies, like one reared in the
shade on many hopes that always yield and never resist. We can,
however, answer Menander's line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"No one can say, I shall not
suffer this or that,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>for a man can say, "I will not do this or that, I will not lie,
I will not play the rogue, I will not cheat, I will not scheme."
For this is in our power, and is no small but great help to ease of
mind. As on the contrary</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"The consciousness of having
done ill deeds,"<a name="FNanchor_760_760" id=
"FNanchor_760_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_760" class=
"fnanchor">760</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>like a sore in the flesh, leaves in the mind a regret which ever
wounds it and pricks it. For reason banishes all other griefs, but
itself creates regret when the soul is vexed with shame and
self-tormented. For as those who shudder in ague-fits or burn in
fevers feel more trouble and distress than those who externally
suffer the same from cold or heat, so the grief is lighter which
comes externally from chance, but that lament,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"None is to blame for this but
I myself,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>coming from within on one's own misdeeds, intensifies one's
bitterness by the shame felt. And so neither costly house, nor
quantity of gold, nor pride of race, nor weighty office, nor grace
of language, nor eloquence, impart so much calm and serenity to
life, as a soul pure from evil acts and desires, having an
imperturbable and undefiled character as the source of its life;
whence good actions flow, producing an enthusiastic and cheerful
energy accompanied by loftiness of thought, and a memory sweeter
and more lasting than that hope which Pindar says is the support of
old age. Censers do not, as Carneades said, after they are emptied,
long retain their sweet smell; but in the mind of the wise man good
actions always leave a fresh and fragrant memory, by which joy is
watered and flourishes, and <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>despises those who wail over
life and abuse it as a region of ills, or as a place of exile for
souls in this world.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xx.</span> I am very taken with
Diogenes' remark to a stranger at Laced&aelig;mon, who was dressing
with much display for a feast, "Does not a good man consider every
day a feast?" And a very great feast too, if we live soberly. For
the world is a most holy and divine temple, into which man is
introduced at his birth, not to behold motionless images made by
hands, but those things (to use the language of Plato) which the
divine mind has exhibited as the visible representations of
invisible things, having innate in them the principle of life and
motion, as the sun moon and stars, and rivers ever flowing with
fresh water, and the earth affording maintenance to plants and
animals. Seeing then that life is the most complete initiation into
all these things, it ought to be full of ease of mind and joy; not
as most people wait for the festivals of Cronos<a name=
"FNanchor_761_761" id="FNanchor_761_761"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_761_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> and Dionysus and the
Panathen&aelig;a and other similar days, that they may joy and
refresh themselves with bought laughter, paying actors and dancers
for the same. On such occasions indeed we sit silently and
decorously, for no one wails when he is initiated, or groans when
he beholds the Pythian games, or when he is drinking at the
festival of Cronos:<a href="#Footnote_761_761" class=
"fnanchor">761</a> but men shame the festivals which the deity
supplies us with and initiates us in, passing most of their time in
lamentation and heaviness of heart and distressing anxiety. And
though men delight in the pleasing notes of musical instruments,
and in the songs of birds, and behold with joy the animals playing
and frisking, and on the contrary are distressed when they roar and
howl and look savage; yet in regard to their own life, when they
see it without smiles and dejected, and ever oppressed and
afflicted by the most wretched sorrows and toils and unending
cares, they do not think of trying to procure alleviation and ease.
How is this? Nay, they will not even listen to others' exhortation,
which would enable them to acquiesce in the present without
repining, and to remember the past with thankfulness, and to meet
the future hopefully and cheerfully without fear or suspicion.</p>

<h3>ON ENVY AND HATRED.</h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Outwardly there seems no
difference between hatred and envy, but they seem identical. For
generally speaking, as vice has many hooks, and is swayed hither
and thither by the passions that hang on it, there are many points
of contact and entanglement between them, for as in the case of
illnesses there is a sympathy between the various passions. Thus
the prosperous man is equally a source of pain to hate and envy.
And so we think benevolence the opposite of both these passions,
being as it is a wish for our neighbour's good, and we think hate
and envy identical, for the desire of both is the very opposite of
benevolence. But since their similarities are not so great as their
dissimilarities, let us investigate and trace out these two
passions from their origin.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> Hatred then is generated
by the fancy that the person hated is either bad generally or bad
to oneself. For those who think they are wronged naturally hate
those who they think wrong them, and dislike and are on their guard
against those who are injurious or bad to others;<a name=
"FNanchor_762_762" id="FNanchor_762_762"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_762_762" class="fnanchor">762</a> but people envy merely
those they think prosperous. So envy seems illimitable, being, like
ophthalmia, troubled at everything bright, whereas hatred is
limited, since it settles only on what seems hostile.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> In the second place
people feel hatred even against the brutes; for some hate cats and
beetles and toads and serpents. Thus Germanicus could not bear the
crowing or sight of a cock, and the Persian magicians kill their
mice, not only hating them themselves but thinking them hateful to
their god, and the Arabians and Ethiopians abominate them as much.
Whereas we envy only human beings.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Indeed among the brutes it
is not likely that there should be any envy, for they have no
conception of prosperity or adversity, nor have they any idea of
reputation or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id=
"Page_313">313</a></span>want of reputation, which are the things
that mainly excite envy; but they hate one another, and are hostile
to one another, and fight with one another to the death, as eagles
and dragons, crows and owls, titmice and finches, insomuch that
they say that even the blood of these creatures will not mix, and
if you try to mix it it will immediately separate again. It is
likely also that there is strong hatred between the cock and the
lion, and the pig and the elephant, owing to fear. For what people
fear they naturally hate. We see also from this that envy differs
from hatred, for the animals are capable of the one, but not of the
other.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> Moreover envy against
anyone is never just, for no one wrongs another by his prosperity,
though that is what he is envied for; but many are hated with
justice, for we even think others<a name="FNanchor_763_763" id=
"FNanchor_763_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_763" class=
"fnanchor">763</a> worthy of hatred, if they do not flee from such,
and are not disgusted and vexed at them. A great indication of this
is that some people admit they hate many, but declare they envy
nobody. Indeed hatred of evil is reckoned among praiseworthy
things; and when some were praising Charillus, the nephew of
Lycurgus and king of Sparta, for his mildness and gentleness, his
colleague said, "How can Charillus be good, who is not even harsh
to the bad?" And so the poet described the bodily defects of
Thersites at much length, whereas he expressed his vile moral
character most shortly and by one remark, "He was most hateful both
to Achilles and Odysseus."<a name="FNanchor_764_764" id=
"FNanchor_764_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_764" class=
"fnanchor">764</a> For to be hated by the most excellent is the
height of worthlessness. But people deny that they are envious,
and, if they are charged with being so, they put forward ten
thousand pleas, saying they are angry with the man or fear him or
hate him, suggesting any other passion than envy, and concealing it
as the only disorder of the soul which is abominable.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> Of necessity then these
two passions cannot, like plants, be fed and nourished and grow on
the same roots; for they are by nature different.<a name=
"FNanchor_765_765" id="FNanchor_765_765"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_765_765" class="fnanchor">765</a> For we hate people
more as they grow worse, but they are envied only the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>more the
more they advance in virtue. And so Themistocles, when quite a lad,
said he had done nothing remarkable, for he was not yet envied. For
as insects attack most ripe corn and roses in their bloom, so envy
fastens most on the good and on those who are growing in virtue and
good repute for moral character. Again extreme badness intensifies
hatred. So hated indeed and loathed were the accusers of Socrates,
as guilty of extreme vileness, by their fellow-citizens, that they
would neither supply them with fire, nor answer their questions,
nor touch the water they had bathed in, but ordered the servants to
pour it away as polluted, till they could bear this hatred no
longer and hung themselves. But splendid and exceptional success
often extinguishes envy. For it is not likely that anyone envied
Alexander or Cyrus, after their conquests made them lords of the
world. But as the sun, when it is high over our heads and sends
down its rays, makes next to no shadow, so at those successes that
attain such a height as to be over its head envy is humbled, and
retires completely dazzled. So Alexander had none to envy him, but
many to hate him, by whom he was plotted against till he died. So
too misfortunes stop envy, but they do not remove hatred. For
people hate their enemies even when they lie prostrate at their
feet, but no one envies the unfortunate. But the remark of one of
the sophists of our day is true, that the envious are very prone to
pity; so here too there is a great difference between these two
passions, for hatred abandons neither the fortunate nor
unfortunate, whereas envy is mitigated in the extreme of either
fortune.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> Let as look at the same
again from opposite points of view. Men put an end to their enmity
and hatred, either if persuaded they have not been wronged, or if
they come round to the view that those they hated are good men and
not bad, or thirdly if they receive a kindness. For, as Thucydides
says, the last favour conferred, even though a smaller one, if it
be seasonable, outweighs a greater offence.<a name=
"FNanchor_766_766" id="FNanchor_766_766"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_766_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> Yet the persuasion
that they have not been wronged does not put an end to envy, for
people envy although absolutely persuaded that they have not been
wronged; and the two <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id=
"Page_315">315</a></span>other cases actually increase envy; for
people look with an evil eye even more on those they think good, as
having virtue, which is the greatest blessing; and if they are
treated kindly by the prosperous it grieves them, for they envy
both their will and power to do kindnesses, the former proceeding
from their goodness, the latter from their prosperity, but both
being blessings. Thus envy is a passion altogether different from
hatred, seeing that what abates the one pains and exasperates the
other.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> Let us now look at the
intent of each of these passions. The intent of the person who
hates is to do as much harm as he can, so they define hatred to be
a disposition and intent on the watch for an opportunity to do
harm. But this is altogether foreign to envy.<a name=
"FNanchor_767_767" id="FNanchor_767_767"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_767_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> For those who envy
their relations and friends would not wish them to come to ruin, or
fall into calamity, but are only annoyed at their prosperity; and
would hinder, if they could, their glory and renown, but they would
not bring upon them irremediable misfortunes: they are content to
remove, as in the case of a lofty house, what stands in their
light.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_315a" id="Page_315a">HOW ONE CAN PRAISE ONESELF
WITHOUT EXCITING ENVY.</a></h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> To speak to other people
about one's own importance or ability, Herculanus, is universally
declared to be tiresome and illiberal, but in fact not many even of
those who censure it avoid its unpleasantness. Thus Euripides,
though he says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"If words had to be bought by
human beings,</span> <span class="i0">No one would wish to trumpet
his own praises.</span> <span class="i0">But since one can get
words <i>sans</i> any payment</span> <span class="i0">From lofty
ether, everyone delights</span> <span class="i0">In speaking truth
or falsehood of himself,</span> <span class="i0">For he can do it
with impunity;"</span></div>
</div>

<p>yet uses much tiresome boasting, intermixing with the passion
and action of his plays irrelevant matter about himself. Similarly
Pindar says, that "to boast unseason<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>ably is to play an
accompaniment to madness,"<a name="FNanchor_768_768" id=
"FNanchor_768_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_768" class=
"fnanchor">768</a> yet he does not cease to talk big about his own
merit, which indeed is well worthy of encomium, who would deny it?
But those who are crowned in the games leave it to others to
celebrate their victories, to avoid the unpleasantness of singing
their own praises. So we are with justice disgusted at Timotheus<a
name="FNanchor_769_769" id="FNanchor_769_769"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_769_769" class="fnanchor">769</a> for trumpeting his own
glory inelegantly and contrary to custom in the inscription for his
victory over Phrynis, "A proud day for you, Timotheus, was it when
the herald cried out, 'The Milesian Timotheus is victorious over
the son of Carbo and his Ionic notes.'" As Xenophon says, "Praise
from others is the pleasantest thing a man can hear,"<a name=
"FNanchor_770_770" id="FNanchor_770_770"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_770_770" class="fnanchor">770</a> but to others a man's
self-praise is most nauseous. For first we think those impudent who
praise themselves, since modesty would be becoming even if they
were praised by others; secondly, we think them unjust in giving
themselves what they ought to receive from others; thirdly, if we
are silent we seem to be vexed and to envy them, and if we are
afraid of this imputation, we are obliged to heap praise upon them
contrary to our real opinion, and to bear them out, undertaking a
task more befitting gross flattery than honour.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> And yet, in spite of all
this, there are occasions when a statesman may venture to speak in
his own praise, not to cry up his own glory and merit, but when the
time and matter demand that he should speak the truth about
himself, as he would about another; especially when it is mentioned
that another has done good and excellent things,<a name=
"FNanchor_771_771" id="FNanchor_771_771"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_771_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> there is no need for
him to suppress the fact that he has done as well. For such
self-praise bears excellent fruit, since much more and better
praise springs from it as from seed. For the statesman does not ask
for reputation as a reward or consolation, nor is he merely pleased
at its attending upon his actions, but he values it because credit
and character give him opportunities to do good on a larger scale.
For it is both easy and pleasant to benefit those who <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>believe in
us and are friendly to us, but it is not easy to act virtuously
against suspicion and calumny, and to force one's benefits on those
that reject them. Let us now consider, if there are any other
reasons warranting self-praise in a statesman, what they are, that,
while we avoid vain glory and disgusting other people, we may not
omit any useful kind of self-praise.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> That is vain glory then
when men seem to praise themselves that they may call forth the
laudation of others; and it is especially despised because it seems
to proceed from ambition and an unseasonable opinion of oneself.
For as those who cannot obtain food are forced to feed on their own
flesh against nature, and that is the end of famine, so those that
hunger after praise, if they get no one else to praise them,
disgrace themselves by their anxiety to feed their own vanity. But
when, not merely content with praising themselves, they vie with
the praise of others, and pit their own deeds and actions against
theirs, with the intent of outshining them, they add envy and
malignity to their vanity. The proverb teaches us that to put our
foot into another's dance is meddlesome and ridiculous; we ought
equally to be on our guard against intruding our own panegyric into
others' praises out of envy and spite, nor should we allow others
either to praise us then, but we should make way for those that are
being honoured, if they are worthy of honour, and even if they seem
to us undeserving of honour and worthless, we ought not to strip
them of their praise by self-laudation, but by direct argument and
proof that they are not worthy of all these encomiums. It is plain
then that we ought to avoid all such conduct as this.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> But self-praise cannot be
blamed, if it is an answer to some charge or calumny, as those
words of Pericles, "And yet you are angry with such a man as me, a
man I take it inferior to no one either in knowledge of what should
be done, or in ability to point out the same, and a lover of my
country to boot, and superior to bribes."<a name="FNanchor_772_772"
id="FNanchor_772_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_772" class=
"fnanchor">772</a> For not only did he avoid all swagger and
vain-glory and ambition in talking thus loftily about himself, but
he also exhi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id=
"Page_318">318</a></span>bited the spirit and greatness of his
virtue, which could abase and crush envy because it could not be
abased itself. For people will hardly condemn such men, for they
are elevated and cheered and inspired by noble self-laudation such
as this, if it have a true basis, as all history testifies. Thus
the Thebans, when their generals were charged with not returning
home, and laying down their office of B&oelig;otarchs when their
time had expired, but instead of that making inroads into Laconia,
and helping Messene, hardly acquitted Pelopidas, who was submissive
and suppliant, but for Epaminondas,<a name="FNanchor_773_773" id=
"FNanchor_773_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_773" class=
"fnanchor">773</a> who gloried in what he had done, and at last
said that he was ready to die, if they would confess that he had
ravaged Laconia, and restored Messene, and made Arcadia one state,
against the will of the Thebans, they would not pass sentence upon
him, but admired his heroism, and with rejoicing and smiles set him
free. So too we must not altogether find fault with Sthenelus in
Homer saying,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"We boast ourselves far better
than our fathers,"<a name="FNanchor_774_774" id=
"FNanchor_774_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_774" class=
"fnanchor">774</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>when we remember the words of Agamemnon,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"How now? thou son of brave
horse-taming Tydeus,</span> <span class="i0">Why dost thou crouch
for fear, and watch far off</span> <span class="i0">The lines of
battle? How unlike thy father!"<a name="FNanchor_775_775" id=
"FNanchor_775_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_775" class=
"fnanchor">775</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>For it was not because he was defamed himself, but he stood up
for his friend<a name="FNanchor_776_776" id=
"FNanchor_776_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_776" class=
"fnanchor">776</a> that was abused, the occasion giving him a
reasonable excuse for self-commendation. So too the Romans were far
from pleased at Cicero's frequently passing encomiums upon himself
in the affair of Catiline, yet when Scipio said they ought not to
try him (Scipio), since he had given them the power to try anybody,
they put on garlands, and accompanied him to the Capitol, and
sacrificed with him. For Cicero was not compelled to praise
himself, but only did so for glory, whereas the danger in which
Scipio stood removed envy from him.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> And not only on one's trial
and in danger, but also in misfortune, is tall talk and boasting
more suitable than in prosperity. For in prosperity people seem to
clutch as it were at glory and enjoy it, and so gratify their
ambition; <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id=
"Page_319">319</a></span>but in adversity, being far from ambition
owing to circumstances, such self-commendation seems to be a
bearing up and fortifying the spirit against fortune, and an
avoidance altogether of that desire for pity and condolence, and
that humility, which we often find in adversity. As then we esteem
those persons vain and without sense who in walking hold themselves
very erect and with a stiff neck, yet in boxing or fighting we
commend such as hold themselves up and alert, so the man struggling
with adversity, who stands up straight against his fate, "in
fighting posture like some boxer,"<a name="FNanchor_777_777" id=
"FNanchor_777_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_777" class=
"fnanchor">777</a> and instead of being humble and abject becomes
through his boasting lofty and dignified, seems to be not offensive
and impudent, but great and invincible. This is why, I suppose,
Homer has represented Patroclus modest and without reproach in
prosperity, yet at the moment of death saying grandiloquently,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Had twenty warriors fought me
such as thou,</span> <span class="i0">All had succumbed to my
victorious spear."<a name="FNanchor_778_778" id=
"FNanchor_778_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_778" class=
"fnanchor">778</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>And Phocion, though in other respects he was gentle, yet after
his sentence exhibited his greatness of soul to many others, and
notably to one of those that were to die with him, who was weeping
and wailing, to whom he said, "What! are you not content to die
with Phocion?"</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> Not less, but still more,
lawful is it for a public man who is wronged to speak on his own
behalf to those who treat him with ingratitude. Thus Achilles
generally conceded glory to the gods, and modestly used such
language as,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i11">"If ever Zeus</span> <span
class="i0">Shall grant to me to sack Troy's well-built town;"<a
name="FNanchor_779_779" id="FNanchor_779_779"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_779_779" class="fnanchor">779</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>but when insulted and outraged contrary to his deserts, he
utters in his rage boastful words,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Alighting from my ships
twelve towns I sacked,"<a name="FNanchor_780_780" id=
"FNanchor_780_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_780" class=
"fnanchor">780</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>and,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"For they will never dare to
face my helmet</span> <span class="i0">When it gleams near."<a
name="FNanchor_781_781" id="FNanchor_781_781"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_781_781" class="fnanchor">781</a></span></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id=
"Page_320">320</a></span>For frank outspokenness, when it is part
of one's defence, admits of boasting. It was in this spirit no
doubt that Themistocles, who neither in word nor deed had given any
offence, when he saw the Athenians were tired of him and treating
him with neglect, did not abstain from saying, "My good sirs, why
do you tire of receiving benefits so frequently at the same hands?"
and<a name="FNanchor_782_782" id="FNanchor_782_782"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_782_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> "When the storm is on
you fly to me for shelter as to a tree, but when fine weather comes
again, then you pass by and strip me of my leaves."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> They then that are
wronged generally mention what they have done well to those who are
ungrateful. And the person who is blamed for what he has done well
is altogether to be pardoned, and not censured, if he passes
encomiums on his own actions: for he is in the position of one not
scolding but making his defence. This it was that made Demosthenes'
freedom of speech splendid, and prevented people being wearied out
by the praise which in all his speech <i>On the Crown</i> he
lavished on himself, pluming himself on those embassies and decrees
in connection with the war with which fault had been found.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> Not very unlike this is
the grace of antithesis, when a person shows that the opposite of
what he is charged with is base and low. Thus Lycurgus when he was
charged at Athens with having bribed an informer to silence,
replied, "What kind of a citizen do you think me, who, having had
so long time the fingering of your public money, am detected in
giving rather than taking unjustly?" And Cicero, when Metellus told
him that he had destroyed more as a witness than he had got
acquitted as an advocate, answered, "Who denies that my honesty is
greater than my eloquence?" Compare such sayings of Demosthenes as,
"Who would not have been justified in killing me, had I tried in
word only to impair the ancient glory of our city?"<a name=
"FNanchor_783_783" id="FNanchor_783_783"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_783_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> And, "What think you
these wretches would have said, if the states had departed, when I
was curiously discussing these points?"<a name="FNanchor_784_784"
id="FNanchor_784_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_784" class=
"fnanchor">784</a> And indeed the whole of that speech <i>On the
Crown</i> most ingeniously introduces his own <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>praises in
his antitheses, and answers to the charges brought against him.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ix.</span> However it is worth while
to notice in his speech that he most artistically inserts praise of
his audience in the remarks about himself, and so makes his speech
less egotistical and less likely to raise envy. Thus he shows how
the Athenians behaved to the Eub&oelig;ans and to the Thebans, and
what benefits they conferred on the people of Byzantium and on the
Chersonese, claiming for himself only a subordinate part in the
matter. Thus he cunningly insinuates into the audience with his own
praises what they will gladly hear, for they rejoice at the
enumeration of their successes,<a name="FNanchor_785_785" id=
"FNanchor_785_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_785" class=
"fnanchor">785</a> and their joy is succeeded by admiration and
esteem for the person to whom the success was due. So also
Epaminondas, when Meneclidas once jeered at him as thinking more of
himself than Agamemnon ever did, replied, "It is your fault then,
men of Thebes, by whose help alone I put down the power of the
Laced&aelig;monians in one day."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">x.</span> But since most people very
much dislike and object to a man's praising himself, but if he
praises some one else are on the contrary often glad and readily
bear him out, some are in the habit of praising in season those
that have the same pursuits business and characters as themselves,
and so conciliate and move the audience in their own favour; for
the audience know at the moment such a one is speaking that, though
he is speaking about another, yet his own similar virtue is worthy
of their praise.<a name="FNanchor_786_786" id=
"FNanchor_786_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_786" class=
"fnanchor">786</a> For as one who throws in another's teeth things
of which he is guilty himself must know that he upbraids himself
most, so the good in paying honour to the good remind those who
know their character of themselves, so that their hearers cry out
at once, "Are not you such a one yourself?" Thus Alexander
honouring Hercules, and Androcottus again honouring Alexander, got
themselves honoured on the same grounds. Dionysius on the contrary
pulling Gelon to pieces, and calling him the Gelos<a name=
"FNanchor_787_787" id="FNanchor_787_787"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_787_787" class="fnanchor">787</a> of Sicily, was not
aware that through his envy he was weakening the importance and
dignity of his own authority.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id=

These things then a public man must generally know and observe. But
those that are compelled to praise themselves do so less
offensively if they do not ascribe all the honour to themselves,
but, being aware that their glory will be tiresome to others, set
it down partly to fortune, partly to the deity. So Achilles said
well,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Since the gods granted us to
kill this hero."<a name="FNanchor_788_788" id=
"FNanchor_788_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_788" class=
"fnanchor">788</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Well also did Timoleon, who erected a temple at Syracuse to the
goddess of Fortune after his success, and dedicated his house to
the Good Genius. Excellently again did Pytho of &AElig;nos, (when
he came to Athens after killing Cotys, and when the demagogues vied
with one another in praising him to the people, and he observed
that some were jealous and displeased,) in coming forward and
saying, "Men of Athens, this is the doing of one of the gods, I
only put my hands to the work." Sulla also forestalled envy by ever
praising fortune, and eventually he proclaimed himself as under the
protection of Aphrodite.<a name="FNanchor_789_789" id=
"FNanchor_789_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_789" class=
"fnanchor">789</a> For men would rather ascribe their defeat to
fortune than the enemy's valour, for in the former case they
consider it an accident, whereas in the latter case they would have
to blame themselves and set it down to their own shortcomings. So
they say the legislation of Zaleucus pleased the Locrians not
least, because he said that Athene visited him from time to time,
and suggested to him and taught him his laws, and that none of
those he promulgated were his own idea and plan.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xii.</span> Perhaps this kind of
remedy by talking people over must be contrived for those who are
altogether crabbed or envious; but for people of moderation it is
not amiss to qualify excessive praise. Thus if anyone should praise
you as learned, or rich, or influential, it would be well to bid
him not talk about you in that strain, but say that you were good
and harmless and useful. For the person that acts so does not
introduce his own praise but transfers it, nor does he seem to
rejoice in people passing encomiums upon him, but rather to be
vexed at their praising him inappropriately and on wrong grounds,
and he seems to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_323" id=
"Page_323">323</a></span>hide bad traits by better ones, not
wishing to be praised, but showing how he ought to be praised. Such
seems the intent of such words as the following, "I have not
fortified the city with stones or bricks, but if you wish to see
how I have fortified it, you will find arms and horses and
allies."<a name="FNanchor_790_790" id="FNanchor_790_790"></a><a
href="#Footnote_790_790" class="fnanchor">790</a> Still more in
point are the last words of Pericles. For as he was dying, and his
friends very naturally were weeping and wailing, and reminded him
of his military services and his power, and the trophies and
victories and towns he had won for Athens, and was leaving as a
legacy, he raised himself up a little and blamed them as praising
him for things common to many, and some of them the results of
fortune rather than merit, while they had passed over the best and
greatest of his deeds and one peculiarly his own, that he had never
been the cause of any Athenian's wearing mourning. This gives the
orator an example, if he be a good man, when praised for his
eloquence, to transfer the praise to his life and character, and
the general who is admired for his skill and good fortune in war to
speak with confidence about his gentleness and uprightness. And
again, if any very extravagant praise is uttered, such as many
people use in flattery which provokes envy, one can reply,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I am no god; why do you liken
me</span> <span class="i0">To the immortals?"<a name=
"FNanchor_791_791" id="FNanchor_791_791"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_791_791" class="fnanchor">791</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>If you really know me, praise my integrity, or my sobriety, or
my kindheartedness, or my philanthropy. For even envy is not
reluctant to give moderate praise to one that deprecates excessive
praise, and true panegyric is not lost by people refusing to accept
idle and false praise. So those kings who would not be called gods
or the sons of gods, but only fond of their brothers or mother, or
benefactors,<a name="FNanchor_792_792" id="FNanchor_792_792"></a><a
href="#Footnote_792_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> or dear to the
gods, did not excite the envy of those that honoured them by those
titles, that were noble but still such as men might claim. Again,
people dislike those writers or speakers who entitle themselves
wise, but they wel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id=
"Page_324">324</a></span>come those who content themselves with
saying that they are lovers of philosophy, and have made some
progress, or use some such moderate language about themselves as
that, which does not excite envy. But rhetorical sophists, who
expect to hear "Divine, wonderful, grand," at their declamations,
are not even welcomed with "Pretty fair, so so."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiii.</span> Moreover, as people
anxious not to injure those who have weak eyes, draw a shade over
too much light, so some people make their praise of themselves less
glaring and absolute, by pointing out some of their small defects,
or miscarriages, or errors, and so remove all risk of making people
offended or envious. Thus Epeus, who boasts very much of his skill
in boxing, and says very confidently,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I can your body crush, and
break your bones,"<a name="FNanchor_793_793" id=
"FNanchor_793_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_793" class=
"fnanchor">793</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>yet says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Is't not enough that I'm in

"FNanchor_794_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_794" class=
"fnanchor">794</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>But Epeus is perhaps a ridiculous instance, excusing his
bragging as an athlete by his confession of timidity and want of
manliness. But agreeable and graceful is that man who mentions his
own forgetfulness, or ignorance, or ambition, or eager desire for
knowledge and conversation. Thus Odysseus of the Sirens,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"My heart to listen to them
did incline,</span> <span class="i0">I bade my comrades by a nod to
unloose me."<a name="FNanchor_795_795" id="FNanchor_795_795"></a><a

</div>

<p>And again of the Cyclops,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I did not hearken (it had

"#Footnote_796_796" class="fnanchor">796</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>And generally speaking the admixture with praise of such faults
as are not altogether base and ignoble stops envy. Thus many have
blunted the point of envy by admitting and introducing, when they
have been praised, their past poverty and straits, aye, and their
low origin. So Agathocles pledging his young men in golden cups
beautifully chased, ordered some earthenware pots to be brought in,
and said, "See the fruits of perseverance, labour, and bravery!
Once I produced pots like these, but now golden cups." <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>For
Agathocles it seems was so low-born and poor that he was brought up
in a potter's shop, though afterwards he was king of almost all
Sicily.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xiv.</span> These are external
remedies against self-praise. There are other internal ones as it
were, such as Cato applied, when he said "he was envied, because he
had to neglect his own affairs, and lie awake every night for the
interests of his country." Compare also the following lines,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"How should I boast? who could
with ease have been</span> <span class="i0">Enrolled among the many
in the army,</span> <span class="i0">And had a fortune equal to the

<p>and,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I shrink from squandering

</div>

<p>For as it is with house and farm, so also is it with glory and
reputation, people for the most part envy those who have got them
easily or for nothing, not those who have bought them at the cost
of much toil and danger.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> Since then we can praise
ourselves not only without causing pain or envy but even usefully
and advantageously, let us consider, that we may not seem to have
only that end in view but some other also, if we might praise
ourselves to excite in our hearers emulation and ambition. For
Nestor, by reciting his battles and acts of prowess, stirred up
Patroclus and nine others to single combat with Hector. For the
exhortation that adds deed to word and example and proper emulation
is animating and moving and stimulating, and with its impulse and
resolution inspires hope that the things we aim at are attainable
and not impossible. That is why in the choruses at Laced&aelig;mon
the old men sing,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"We once were young and
vigorous and strong,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>and then the boys,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"We shall be stronger far than
now we are,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>and then the youths,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"We now are strong, look at us
if you like."</span></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id=
"Page_326">326</a></span> In this wise and statesmanlike manner did
the legislator exhibit to the young men the nearest and dearest
examples of what they should do in the persons of those who had
done so.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> Moreover it is not amiss
sometimes, to awe and repress and take down and tame the impudent
and bold, to boast and talk a little big about oneself. As Nestor
did, to mention him again,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"For I have mixed ere now with
better men</span> <span class="i0">Than both of you, and ne'er did
they despise me."<a name="FNanchor_798_798" id=

"fnanchor">798</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>So also Aristotle told Alexander that not only had they that
were rulers over many subjects a right to think highly of
themselves, but also those that had right views about the gods.
Useful too against our enemies and foes is the following line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Ill-starred are they whose
sons encounter me."<a name="FNanchor_799_799" id=
"FNanchor_799_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_799" class=

</div>

<p>Compare also the remark of Agesilaus about the king of the
Persians, who was called great, "How is he greater than me, if he
is not also more upright?" And that also of Epaminondas to the
Laced&aelig;monians who were inveighing against the Thebans,
"Anyhow we have made you talk at greater length than usual." But
these kind of remarks are fitting for enemies and foes; but our
boasting is also good on occasion for friends and fellow-citizens,
not only to abate their pride and make them more humble, but also
when they are in fear and dejection to raise them up again and give
them confidence. Thus Cyrus talked big in perils and on
battle-fields, though at other times he was no boaster. And the
second Antigonus, though he was on all other occasions modest and
far from vanity, yet in the sea-fight off Cos, when one of his
friends said to him, "See you not how many more ships the enemy
have got than we have?" answered, "How many do you make me equal to
then?" This Homer also seems to have noticed. For he has
represented Odysseus, when his comrades were dreadfully afraid of
the noise and whirlpool of Charybdis, reminding them of his former
cleverness and valour;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"We are in no worse plight

<p>For such is not the self-praise of a demagogue or sophist, or of
one that asks for clapping or applause, but of one who makes his
valour and experience a pledge of confidence to his friends. For in
critical conjunctures the reputation and credit of one who has
experience and capacity in command plays a great part in insuring
safety.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvii.</span> As I have said before,
to pit oneself against another's praise and reputation is by no
means fitting for a public man: however, in important matters,
where mistaken praise is injurious and detrimental, it is not amiss
to confute it, or rather to divert the hearer to what is better by
showing him the difference between true and false merit. Anyone
would be glad, I suppose, when vice was abused and censured, to see
most people voluntarily keep aloof from it; but if vice should be
well thought of, and honour and reputation come to the person who
promoted its pleasures or desires, no nature is so well constituted
or strong that it would not be mastered by it. So the public man
must oppose the praise not of men but of bad actions, for such
praise is corrupting, and causes people to imitate and emulate what
is base as if it were noble. But it is best refuted by putting it
side by side with the truth: as Theodorus the tragic actor is
reported to have said once to Satyrus the comic actor, "It is not
so wonderful to make an audience laugh as to make them weep and
cry." But what if some philosopher had answered him, "To make an
audience weep and cry is not so noble a thing as to make them
forget their sorrows." This kind of self-laudation benefits the
hearer, and changes his opinion. Compare the remark of Zeno in
reference to the number of Theophrastus' scholars, "His is a larger
body, but mine are better taught." And Phocion, when Leosthenes was
still in prosperity, being asked by the orators what benefit he had
conferred on the city, replied, "Only this, that during my period
of office there has been no funeral oration, but all <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>the dead
have been buried in their fathers' sepulchres." Wittily also did
Crates parody the lines,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Eating and wantonness and
love's delights</span> <span class="i0">Are all I
value,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>with</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Learning and those grand
things the Muses teach one</span> <span class="i0">Are all I
value."</span></div>
</div>

<p>Such self-praise is good and useful and teaches people to admire
and love what is valuable and expedient instead of what is vain and
superfluous. Let so much suffice on the question proposed.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xviii.</span> It remains to me now to
point out, what our subject next demands and calls for, how
everyone may avoid unseasonable self-praise. For there is a
wonderful incentive to talking about oneself in self-love, which is
frequently strongly implanted in those who seem to have only
moderate aspirations for fame. For as it is one of the rules to
preserve good health to avoid altogether places where sickness is,
or to exercise the greatest precaution if one must go there, so
talking about oneself has its slippery times and places that draw
it on on any pretext. For first, when others are praised, as I said
before, ambition makes people talk about themselves, and a certain
desire and impulse for fame which is hard to check bites and
tickles that ambition, especially if the other person is praised
for the same things or less important things than the hearer thinks
he is a proficient in. For as hungry people have their appetite
more inflamed and sharpened by seeing others eat, so the praise of
one's neighbours makes those who eagerly desire fame to blaze out
into jealousy.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xix.</span> In the second place the
narration of things done successfully and to people's mind entices
many unawares to boasting and bragging in their joy; for falling
into conversation about their victories, or success in state
affairs, or their words or deeds commended by great men, they
cannot keep themselves within bounds. With this kind of
self-laudation you may see that soldiers and sailors are most
taken. To be in this state of mind also frequently happens to those
who have returned from important posts and responsible duties, for
in their mention of illustrious<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span> men and men of royal rank
they insert the encomiums they have passed on themselves, and do
not so much think they are praising themselves as merely repeating
the praises of others about themselves. Others think their hearers
do not detect them at all of self-praise, when they recount the
greeting and welcome and kindness they have received from kings and
emperors, but only imagine them to be enumerating the courtesy and
kindliness of those great personages. So we must be very much on
our guard in praising others to free ourselves from all suspicion
of self-love and self-recommendation, and not to seem to be really
praising ourselves "under pretext of Patroclus."<a name=
"FNanchor_801_801" id="FNanchor_801_801"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_801_801" class="fnanchor">801</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xx.</span> Moreover that kind of
conversation that mainly consists of censuring and running down
others is dangerous as giving opportunity for self-laudation to
those who pine for fame. A fault into which old men especially
fall, when they are led to scold others and censure their bad ways
and faulty actions, and so extol themselves as being remarkably the
opposite. In old men we must allow all this, especially if to age
they add reputation and merit, for such fault-finding is not
without use, and inspires those who are rebuked with both emulation
and love of honour.<a name="FNanchor_802_802" id=
"FNanchor_802_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_802" class=
"fnanchor">802</a> But all other persons must especially avoid and
fear that roundabout kind of self-praise. For since generally
speaking censuring one's neighbours is disagreeable and barely
tolerable and requires great wariness, he that mixes up his own
praise with blame of another, and hunts for fame by defaming
another, is altogether tiresome and inspires disgust, for he seems
to wish to get credit through trying to prove others unworthy of
credit.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxi.</span> Furthermore, as those
that are naturally prone and inclined to laughter must be
especially on their guard against tickling and touching, such as
excites that propensity by contact with the smoothest parts of the
body, so those that have a great passion for reputation ought to be
especially advised to abstain from praising themselves when they
are praised by others. For a person ought to blush when praised,
and not to be past blushing from <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>impudence, and ought to
check those who extol him too highly, and not to rebuke them for
praising him too little; though very many people do so, themselves
prompting and reminding their praisers of others of their own acts
and virtues, till by their own praise they spoil the effect of the
praise that others give them. For some tickle and puff themselves
up by self-praise, while others, malignantly holding out the small
bait of eulogy, provoke others to talk about themselves, while
others again ask questions and put inquiries, as was done to the
soldier in Menander, merely to poke fun at him;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"'How did you get this wound?'
'Sir, by a javelin.'</span> <span class="i0">'How in the name of

fastened to a wall.'</span> <span class="i0">I show my wound to
them in serious earnest,</span> <span class="i0">But they for their
part only mock at me."</span></div>
</div>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxii.</span> As regards all these
points then we must be on our guard as much as possible not to
launch out into praise of ourselves, or yield to it in consequence
of questions put to us to draw us. And the best caution and
security against this is to pay attention to others who praise
themselves, and to consider how disagreeable and objectionable the
practice is to everybody, and that no other conversation is so
offensive and tiring. For though we cannot say that we suffer any
other evil at the hands of those who praise themselves, yet being
naturally bored by the practice, and avoiding it, we are anxious to
get rid of them and breathe again; insomuch that even the flatterer
and parasite and needy person in his distress finds the rich man or
satrap or king praising himself hard to bear and wellnigh
intolerable; and they say that having to listen to all this is
paying a very large shot to their entertainment, like the fellow in
Menander;</p>

<h3><a name="Page_331a" id="Page_331a" />ON THOSE WHO ARE PUNISHED
BY THE DEITY LATE.</h3>

<p><i>A discussion between Patrocleas, Plutarch, Timon, and
Olympicus.</i></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> When Epicurus had made
these remarks, Quintus, and before any of us who were at the end of
the porch<a name="FNanchor_806_806" id="FNanchor_806_806"></a><a
href="#Footnote_806_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> could reply, he
went off abruptly. And we, marvelling somewhat at his rudeness,
stood still silently but looked at one another, and then turned and
pursued our walk as before. And Patrocleas was the first to speak.
"Are we," said he, "to leave the question unanswered, or are we to
reply to his argument in his absence as if he were present?" Then
said Timon, "Because he went off the moment he had thrown his
missile at us, it would not be good surely to leave it sticking in
us; for we are told that Brasidas plucked the javelin that had been
thrown at him out of his body, and with it killed the hurler of it;
but there is of course no need for us to avenge ourselves so on
those that have launched on us an absurd or false argument, it will
be enough to dislodge the notion before it gets fixed in us." Then
said I, "Which of his words has moved you <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>most? For the fellow
seemed to rampage about, in his anger and abusive language, with a
long disconnected and rambling rhapsody drawn from all sources, and
at the same time inveighed against Providence."</p>

<p><a name="Page_332a" id="Page_332a" />&sect; <span class=
"smcap">ii.</span> Then said Patrocleas, "The slowness and delay of
the deity in punishing the wicked used to seem<a name=
"FNanchor_807_807" id="FNanchor_807_807"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_807_807" class="fnanchor">807</a> to me a very dreadful
thing, but now in consequence of his speech I come as it were new
and fresh to the notion. Yet long ago I was vexed when I heard that
line of Euripides,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"He does delay, such is the
Deity</span> <span class="i0">In nature."<a name="FNanchor_808_808"
id="FNanchor_808_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_808" class=
"fnanchor">808</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>For indeed it is not fitting that the deity should be slow in
anything, and least of all in the punishment of the wicked, seeing
that they are not slow or sluggish in doing evil, but are hurried
by their passions into crime at headlong speed. Moreover, as
Thucydides<a name="FNanchor_809_809" id="FNanchor_809_809"></a><a
href="#Footnote_809_809" class="fnanchor">809</a> says, when
punishment follows as closely as possible upon wrong-doing, it
blocks up the road at once for those who would follow up their
villainy if it were successful. For no debt so much as that of
justice paid behind time damps the hopes and dejects the mind of
the wronged person, and aggravates the audacity and daring of the
wrong-doer; whereas the punishment that follows crime immediately
not only checks future outbreaks but is also the greatest possible
comfort to the injured. And so I am often troubled when I consider
that remark of Bias, who told, it seems, a bad man that he was not
afraid that he would escape punishment, but that he would not live
to see it. For how did the Messenians who were killed long before
derive any benefit from the punishment of Aristocrates? For he had
been guilty of treason at the battle of <i>The Great Trench</i>,
but had reigned over the Arcadians for more than twenty years
without being found out, but afterwards was detected and paid the
penalty, but they were no longer alive.<a name="FNanchor_810_810"
id="FNanchor_810_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_810" class=
"fnanchor">810</a> Or what consolation was brought to the people of
Orchomenus, who lost their sons and friends and relatives in
consequence of the treason of <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>Lyciscus, by the disease
which settled upon him long afterwards and spread all over his
body? For he used to go and dip and soak his feet in the river, and
uttered imprecations and prayed that they might rot off if he was
guilty of treason or crime. Nor was it permitted to the children's
children of those that were slain to see at Athens the tearing out
of their graves the bodies of those atrocious criminals that had
killed them, and the carrying them beyond their borders. And so it
seems strange in Euripides using the following argument to deter
people from vice:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Fear not, for vengeance will
not strike at once</span> <span class="i0">Your heart, or that of
any guilty wretch,</span> <span class="i0">But silently and with
slow foot it moves,<a name="FNanchor_811_811" id=
"FNanchor_811_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_811" class=
"fnanchor">811</a></span> <span class="i0">And when their time's
come will the wicked reach."</span></div>
</div>

<p>This is no doubt the very reason why the wicked incite and cheer
themselves on to commit lawless acts, for crime shows them a fruit
visible and ripe at once, but a punishment late, and long
subsequent to the enjoyment."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> When Patrocleas had said
thus much, Olympicus interfered, "There is another consideration,
Patrocleas, the great absurdity involved in these delays and
long-suffering of the deity. For the slowness of punishment takes
away belief in providence, and the wicked, observing that no evil
follows each crime except long afterwards, attribute it when it
comes to mischance, and look upon it in the light more of accident
than punishment, and so receive no benefit from it, being grieved
indeed when the misfortune comes, but feeling no remorse for what
they have done amiss. For, as in the case of a horse, the whipping
or spurring that immediately follows upon a stumble or some other
fault is a corrective and brings him to his duty, but pulling and
backing him with the bit and shouting at him long afterwards seems
to come from some other motive than a desire to teach him, for he
is put to pain without being shown his fault; so the vice which
each time it stumbles or offends is at once punished and checked by
correction is most likely<a name="FNanchor_812_812" id=
"FNanchor_812_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_812" class=
"fnanchor">812</a> to come to itself and be humble <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>and stand
in awe of the deity, as one that beholds men's acts and passions
and does not punish behind time; whereas that justice that,
according to Euripides, "steals on silently and with slow foot,"
and falls upon the wicked some time or other, seems to resemble
more chance than providence by reason, of its uncertainty, delay,
and irregularity. So that I do not see what benefit there is in
those mills of the gods that are said to grind late,<a name=
"FNanchor_813_813" id="FNanchor_813_813"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_813_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> since they obscure the
punishment, and obliterate the fear, of evil-doing."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> When Olympicus had done
speaking, and I was musing with myself on the matter, Timon said,
"Am I to put the finishing touch of difficulty on our subject, or
am I to let him first contend earnestly against these views?" Then
said I, "Why should we bring up the third wave<a name=
"FNanchor_814_814" id="FNanchor_814_814"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_814_814" class="fnanchor">814</a> and drown the
argument, if he is not able to refute or evade the charges already
brought? To begin then with the domestic hearth, as the saying
is,<a name="FNanchor_815_815" id="FNanchor_815_815"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_815_815" class="fnanchor">815</a> let us imitate that
cautious manner of speaking about the deity in vogue among the
Academic philosophers, and decline to speak about these things as
if we thoroughly understood them. For it is worse in us mortals
than for people ignorant of music to discuss music, or for people
ignorant of military matters to discuss the art of war, to examine
too closely into the nature of the gods and demons, like people
with no knowledge of art trying to get at the intention of artists
from opinion and fancy and probabilities. For if<a name=
"FNanchor_816_816" id="FNanchor_816_816"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_816_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> it is no easy matter
for anyone not a professional to conjecture why the surgeon
performed an operation later rather than sooner, or why he ordered
his patient to take a bath to-day rather than yesterday, how is it
easy or safe for a mortal to say anything else about the deity than
that he knows best the time to cure vice, and applies to each his
punishment as the doctor administers a drug, and that a punishment
not of the same magnitude, or applied at the same time, in all
cases. For that the cure of the soul, which is called justice, is
the greatest of all arts is testified <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>by Pindar as well as by
ten thousand others, for he calls God, the ruler and lord of all
things, the greatest artificer as the creator of justice, whose
function it is to determine when, and how, and how far, each bad
man is to be punished. And Plato says that Minos, the son of Zeus,
was his father's pupil in this art, not thinking it possible that
any one could succeed in justice, or understand how to succeed in
it, without he had learned or somehow got that science. For the
laws which men make are not always merely reasonable, nor is their
meaning always apparent, but some injunctions seem quite
ridiculous, for example, the Ephors at Laced&aelig;mon make
proclamation, directly they take office, that no one is to let his
moustache grow, but that all are to obey the laws, that they be not
grievous to them. And the Romans lay a light rod on the bodies of
those they make freemen, and when they make their wills, they
nominate some as their heirs, while to others they sell the
property, which, seems strange. But strangest of all is that
ordinance of Solon, that the citizen who, when his city is in
faction, will not side with either party is to lose his civic
rights. And generally one might mention many absurdities in laws,
if one did not know the mind of the legislator, or understand the
reason for each particular piece of legislation. How is it
wonderful then, if human affairs are so difficult to comprehend,
that it is no easy task to say in connection with the gods, why
they punish some offenders early, and others late?</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> This is not a pretext for
evading the subject, but merely a request for lenient judgement,
that our discourse, looking as it were for a haven and place of
refuge, may rise to the difficulty with greater confidence basing
itself on probability. Consider then first that, according to
Plato, god, making himself openly a pattern of all things good,
concedes human virtue, which is in some sort a resemblance to
himself, to those who are able to follow him. For all nature, being
in disorder, got the principle of change and became order<a name=
"FNanchor_817_817" id="FNanchor_817_817"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_817_817" class="fnanchor">817</a> by a resemblance to
and participation in the nature and virtue of the deity. The same
Plato also tells us that nature put eyesight into us, in order that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id=
"Page_336">336</a></span>the soul by beholding and admiring the
heavenly bodies might accustom itself to welcome and love harmony
and order, and might hate disorderly and roving propensities, and
avoid aimless reliance on chance, as the parent of all vice and
error. For man can enjoy no greater blessing from god than to
attain to virtue by the earnest imitation of the noblest qualities
of the divine nature. And so he punishes the wicked leisurely and
long after, not being afraid of error or after repentance through
punishing too hastily, but to take away from us that eager and
brutish thirst for revenge, and to teach us that we are not to
retaliate on those that have offended us in anger, and when the
soul is most inflamed and distorted with passion and almost beside
itself for rage, like people satisfying fierce thirst or hunger,
but to imitate the mildness and long-suffering of the deity, and to
avenge ourselves in an orderly and decent manner, only when we have
taken counsel with time long enough to give us the least possible
likelihood of after repentance. For it is a smaller evil, as
Socrates said, to drink dirty water when excessively thirsty, than,
when one's mind is disturbed and full of rage and fury, before it
is settled and becomes pure, to glut our revenge on the person of a
relation and kinsman. For it is not the punishment that follows as
closely as possible upon wrong-doing, as Thucydides said,<a name=
"FNanchor_818_818" id="FNanchor_818_818"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_818_818" class="fnanchor">818</a> but that which is more
remote, that observes decorum. For as Melanthius says of anger,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Fell things it does when it
the mind unsettles,"<a name="FNanchor_819_819" id=
"FNanchor_819_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_819" class=
"fnanchor">819</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>so also reason acts with justice and moderation, when it
banishes rage and passion. So also people are made milder by the
example of other men, as when they hear that Plato, when he held
his stick over his slave to correct him, waited some time, as he
himself has told us, to compose his anger; and that Archytas,
having learned of some wrong or disorderly action on the part of
some of his farm labourers, knowing that at the time he was in a
very great rage and highly incensed at them, did nothing to them,
but merely departed, saying, "You may thank your stars that I am in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id=
"Page_337">337</a></span>a rage with you." If then the remembrance
of the words and recorded acts of men abates the fierceness and
intensity of our rage, much more likely is it that we (observing
that the deity, though without either fear or repentance in any
case, yet puts off his punishments and defers them for some time)
shall be reserved in our views about such matters, and shall think
that mildness and long-suffering which the god exhibits a divine
part of virtue, reforming a few by speedy punishment, but
benefiting and correcting many by a tardy one.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> Let us consider in the
second place that punishments inflicted by men for offences regard
only retaliation, and, when the offender is punished, stop and go
no further; so that they seem to follow offences yelping at them
like a dog, and closely pursuing at their heels as it were. But it
is likely that the deity would look at the state of any guilty soul
that he intended to punish, if haply it might turn and repent, and
would give<a name="FNanchor_820_820" id="FNanchor_820_820"></a><a
href="#Footnote_820_820" class="fnanchor">820</a> time for
reformation to all whose vice was not absolute and incurable. For
knowing how great a share of virtue souls come into the world with,
deriving it from him, and how strong and lasting is their nobility
of nature, and how it breaks out into vice against its natural
disposition through the corruption of bad habits and companions,
and afterwards in some cases reforms itself, and recovers its
proper position, he does not inflict punishment on all persons
alike; but the incorrigible he at once removes from life and cuts
off, since it is altogether injurious to others, but most of all to
a man's own self, to live in perpetual vice, whereas to those who
seem to have fallen into wrong-doing, rather from ignorance of what
was good than from deliberate choice of what was bad, he gives time
to repent. But if they persist in vice he punishes them too, for he
has no fear that they will escape him. Consider also how many
changes take place in the life and character of men, so that the
Greeks give the names &tau;&rho;&#8057;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf; and
&#7974;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf; to the character, the first word
meaning <i>change</i>, and the latter the immense force and power
of <i>habit</i>. I think also that the ancients called Cecrops half
man and half dragon<a name="FNanchor_821_821" id=
"FNanchor_821_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_821" class=
"fnanchor">821</a> <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id=
"Page_338">338</a></span>not because, as some say, he became from a
good king wild and dragon-like, but contrariwise because he was
originally perverse and terrible, and afterwards became a mild and
humane king. And if this is uncertain, at any rate we know that
Gelon and Hiero, both Sicilians, and Pisistratus the son of
Hippocrates, though they got their supreme power by bad means, yet
used it for virtuous ends, and though they mounted the throne in an
irregular way, yet became good and useful princes. For by good
legislation and by encouraging agriculture they made the citizens
earnest and industrious instead of scoffers and chatterers. As for
Gelon, after fighting valiantly and defeating the Carthaginians in
a great battle, he would not conclude with them the peace they
asked for until they inserted an article promising to cease
sacrificing their sons to Cronos. And Lydiades was tyrant in
Megalopolis, yet in the very height of his power changing his ideas
and being disgusted with injustice, he restored their old
constitution to the citizens,<a name="FNanchor_822_822" id=
"FNanchor_822_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_822" class=
"fnanchor">822</a> and fell gloriously, fighting against the enemy
in behalf of his country. And if any one had slain prematurely
Miltiades the tyrant of the Chersonese, or had prosecuted and got a
conviction against Cimon for incest with his sister, or had
deprived Athens of Themistocles for his wantonness and revellings
and outrages in the market, as in later days Athens lost
Alcibiades, by an indictment, should we not have had to go without
the glory of Marathon, and Eurymedon, and beautiful Artemisium,
"where the Athenian youth laid the bright base of liberty?"<a name=

produce nothing little, nor can their energy and activity rust
owing to their keen intellect, but they toss to and fro as at sea
till they come to a settled and durable character. As then one
inexperienced in farming, seeing a spot full of thick bushes and
rank growth, full of wild beasts and streams and mud, would not
think much of it, while to one who has learnt how to discriminate
and discern between different kind of soils all these are various
tokens of the richness and goodness of the land, so great natures
break out into many strange excesses, which exasperate us at first
beyond bearing, so that we think it right to cut off such offenders
and <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id=
"Page_339">339</a></span>stop their career at once, whereas a
better judge, seeing the good and noble even in these, waits for
age and the season which nature appoints for gathering fruit to
bring sense and virtue.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> So much for this point.
Do you not think also that some of the Greeks did well to adopt
that Egyptian law which orders a pregnant woman condemned to death
not to suffer the penalty till after she has given birth?"
"Certainly," said all the company. I continued, "Put the case not
of a woman pregnant, but of a man who can in process of time bring
to light and reveal some secret act or plan, point out some unknown
evil, or devise some scheme of safety, or invent something useful
and necessary, would it not be better to defer his execution, and
wait the result of his meditation? That is my opinion, at least."
"So we all think," said Patrocleas. "Quite right," said I. "For do
but consider, had Dionysius had vengeance taken on him at the
beginning of his tyranny, none of the Greeks would have dwelt in
Sicily, which was laid waste by the Carthaginians. Nor would the
Greeks have dwelt in Apollonia, or Anactorium, or the peninsula of
the Leucadians, had not Periander's chastisement been postponed for
a long time. I think also that Cassander's punishment was deferred
that Thebes might be repeopled. And of the mercenaries that
plundered this very temple most crossed over into Sicily with
Timoleon, and after they had conquered the Carthaginians and put
down their authority, perished miserably, miserable wretches that
they were. For no doubt the deity makes use of some wicked men, as
executioners, to punish others, and so I think he crushes as it
were most tyrants. For as the gall of the hyena and rennet of the
seal, both nasty beasts in all other respects, are useful in
certain diseases, so when some need sharp correction, the deity
casts upon them the implacable fury of some tyrant, or the savage
ferocity of some prince, and does not remove the bane and trouble
till their fault be got rid of and purged. Such a potion was
Phalaris to the Agrigentines, and Marius to the Romans. And to the
people of Sicyon the god distinctly foretold that their city needed
a scourge, when they took away from the Cleon&aelig;ans (as if he
was a Sicyonian) the lad Teletias, who was crowned<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span> in the
Pythian games, and tore him to pieces. As for the Sicyonians,
Orthagoras became their tyrant, and subsequently Myro and
Clisthenes, and these three checked their wanton outbreaks; but the
Cleon&aelig;ans, not getting such a cure, went to ruin. You have of
course heard Homer's lines,</p>

<div class="poem">

at Rome was the son of Pompeius Strabo, whose dead body the Roman
people cast out and trampled upon, so great was their hatred of
him. How is it strange then, since the farmer does not cut down the
thorn till he has taken his asparagus, nor do the Libyans burn the
twigs till they have gathered the ledanum, that god does not
exterminate the wicked and rugged root of an illustrious and royal
race till it has produced its fit fruit? For it would have been
better for the Phocians to have lost ten thousand of the oxen and
horses of Iphitus, and for more gold and silver to have gone from
Delphi, than that Odysseus and &AElig;sculapius should not have
been born, nor those others who from bad and wicked men became good
and useful."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> "And do you not all
think that it is better that punishment should take place at the
fitting time and in the fitting manner rather than quickly and on
the spur of the moment? Consider the case of Callippus, who with
the very dagger with which he slew Dion, pretending to be his
friend, was afterwards slain by his own friends. And when Mitius
the Argive was killed in a tumult, a brazen statue in the
market-place fell on his murderer and killed him during the public
games. And of course, Patrocleas, you know all about Bessus the
P&aelig;onian, and about Aristo the &OElig;t&aelig;an leader of
mercenaries." "Not I, by Zeus," said Patrocleas, "but I should like
to hear." "Aristo," I <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id=

tyrants removed the necklace of Eriphyle<a name="FNanchor_826_826"

his wife as a present; but his son being angry with his mother for
some reason or other, set the house on fire, and burnt all that
were in it. As for Bessus, it seems he had killed his father,
though his crime was long undiscovered. But at last going to sup
with some strangers, he knocked down a nest of swallows, pricking
it with his lance, and killed all the young swallows. And when the
company said, as it was likely they would, 'Whatever makes you act
in such a strange manner?' 'Have they not,' he replied, 'been long
bearing false witness against me, crying out that I had killed my
father?' And the company, astonished at his answer, laid the matter
before the king, and the affair was inquired into, and Bessus
punished."</p>

continued, "we cite supposing, as has been laid down, that there is
a deferring of punishment to the wicked; and, for the rest, I think
we ought to listen to Hesiod, who tells us&mdash;not like Plato,

crime&mdash;that it is contemporaneous with it, and grows with it

<p>The cantharis is said to have in itself the antidote to its own
sting, but wickedness, creating its own pain and torment, pays the
penalty of its misdeeds not afterwards but at the time of its
ill-doing. And as every malefactor about to pay the penalty of his
crime in his person bears his cross, so vice fabricates for itself
each of its own torments, being the terrible author of its own
misery in life, wherein in addition to shame it has frequent fears
and fierce passions and endless remorse and anxiety. But some are
just <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id=
"Page_342">342</a></span>like children, who, seeing malefactors in
the theatres in golden tunics and purple robes with crowns on and
dancing, admire them and marvel at them, thinking them happy, till
they see them goaded and lashed and issuing fire from their gaudy

households and conspicuous offices and great power, are yet being
secretly punished before they are seen to be murdered or hurled
down rocks, which is rather the climax and end of their punishment
than the punishment itself. For as Plato tells us that Herodicus
the Selymbrian having fallen into consumption, an incurable
disease, was the first of mankind to mix exercise with the art of
healing, and so prolonged his own life and that of others suffering
from the same disease, so those wicked persons who seem to avoid
immediate punishment, receive a longer and not slower punishment,
not later but extending over a wider period; for they are not
punished in their old age, but rather grow old in perpetual
punishment. I speak of course of long time as a human being, for to
the gods all the period of man's life is as nothing, and so to them
'now and not thirty years ago' means no more than with us torturing
or hanging a malefactor in the evening instead of the morning would
mean; especially as man is shut up in life as in a prison from
which there is no egress or escape, and though doubtless during his
life he has much feasting and business and gifts and favours and
amusement, yet, just like people playing at dice or draughts in a
prison, the rope is all the time hanging over his head."<a name=

freezing and curdling of his blood, if we consider the last moment

<p>For the recklessness and audacity of vice is strong and rampant
till the crime is committed, but afterwards, when the passion
subsides like a storm, it becomes timid and dejected and a prey to
fears and superstitions. So that Stesichorus in his account of
Clyt&aelig;mnestra's dream may have represented the facts and real
state of the case, where he says, "A dragon seemed to appear to her
with its lofty head smeared all over with blood, and out of it
seemed to come king Orestes the grandson of Plisthenes." For
visions in dreams, and apparitions during the day, and oracles, and
lightning, and whatever is thought to come from the deity, bring
tempests of apprehension to the guilty. So they say that one time
Apollodorus in a dream saw himself flayed by the Scythians, and
then boiled, and that his heart out of the caldron spoke to him in
a low voice and said, "I am the cause of this;" and at another time
he dreamed that he saw his daughters running round him in a circle
all on fire and in flames. And Hipparchus the son of Pisistratus, a
little before his death, dreamt that Aphrodite threw some blood on
his face out of a certain phial. And the friends of Ptolemy
Ceraunus dreamed that he was summoned for trial by Seleucus, and
that the judges were vultures and wolves, who tore his flesh and
distributed it wholesale among his enemies. And Pausanias at
Byzantium, having sent for Cleonice a free-born maiden, intending
to outrage her and pass the night with her, being seized with some
alarm or suspicion killed her, and frequently saw her in his dreams
saying to him, "Come near for judgement, lust is most assuredly a
grievous bane to men," and as this apparition did not cease, he
sailed, it seems, to Heraclea to the place where the souls of the
dead could be summoned, and by propitiations and sacrifices called
up the soul of the maiden, and she appeared to him<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span> and told
him that this trouble would end when he got to Laced&aelig;mon, and
directly he got there he died."<a name="FNanchor_831_831" id=

<p><a name="Page_344a" id="Page_344a" />&sect; <span class=
"smcap">xi.</span> "And so, if nothing happens to the soul after
death, but that event is the end of all enjoyment or punishment,
one would be rather inclined to say that the deity was lax and
indulgent in quickly punishing the wicked and depriving them of
life. For even if we were to say that the wicked had no other
trouble in a long life, yet, when their wrong-doing was proved to
bring them no profit or enjoyment, no good or adequate return for
their many and great anxieties, the consciousness of that would be
quite enough to throw<a name="FNanchor_832_832" id=
"FNanchor_832_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_832" class=
"fnanchor">832</a> their mind off its balance. So they record of
Lysimachus that he was so overcome by thirst that he surrendered
himself and his forces to the Get&aelig; for some drink, but after
he had drunk and bethought him that he was now a captive, he said,
"Alas! How guilty am I for so brief a gratification to lose so
great a kingdom!" And yet it is very difficult to resist a
necessity of nature. But when a man, either for the love of money,
or for political place or power, or carried away by some amorous
propensity, does some lawless and dreadful deed, and, after his
eager desire is satisfied, sees in process of time that only the
base and terrible elements of his crime remain, while nothing
useful, or necessary, or advantageous has flowed from it, is it not
likely that the idea would often present itself to him that, moved
by vain-glory, or for some illiberal and unlovely pleasure, he had
violated the greatest and noblest rights of mankind, and had filled
his life with shame and trouble? For as Simonides used to say
playfully that he always found his money-chest full but his
gratitude-chest empty,<a name="FNanchor_833_833" id=
"FNanchor_833_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_833" class=

find out that their gratification is joyless and hopeless,<a name=
"FNanchor_834_834" id="FNanchor_834_834"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_834_834" class="fnanchor">834</a> and ever attended by
fears and griefs and gloomy memories, and suspicions about the
future, and distrust about the present. Thus we hear Ino, repenting
for what she had done, saying on the stage,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id=

<p>It is likely that the soul of every wicked person will meditate
in this way, and consider how it can escape the memory of its
ill-deeds, and lay its conscience to sleep, and become pure, and
live another life over again from the beginning. For there is no
confidence, or reality, or continuance, or security, in what
wickedness proposes to itself, unless by Zeus we shall say that
evil-doers are wise, but wherever the greedy love of wealth or
pleasure or violent envy dwells with hatred and malignity, there
will you also see and find stationed superstition, and remissness
for labour, and cowardice in respect to death, and sudden caprice
in the passions, and vain-glory and boasting. Those that censure
them frighten them, and they even fear those that praise them as
wronged by their deceit, and as most hostile to the bad because
they readily praise those they think good. For as in the case of
ill-tempered steel the hardness of vice is rotten, and its strength
easily shattered. So that in course of time, understanding their
real selves, they are vexed and disgusted with their past life and
abhor it. For if a bad man who restores property entrusted to his
care, or becomes surety for a friend, or contributes very
generously and liberally to his country out of love of glory or
honour, at once repents and is sorry for what he has done from the
fickleness and changeableness of his mind; and if men applauded in
the theatres directly afterwards groan, their love of glory
subsiding into love of money; shall we suppose that those who
sacrificed men to tyrannies and conspiracies as Apollodorus did, or
that those who robbed their friends of money as Glaucus the son of
Epicydes did,<a name="FNanchor_836_836" id=
"FNanchor_836_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_836" class=
"fnanchor">836</a> never repented, or loathed themselves, or
regretted their past misdeeds? For my part, if it is lawful to say
so, I do not think evil-doers need any god or man to punish them,
for the marring and troubling of all their life by vice is in
itself adequate punishment."</p>

<p><a name="Page_345a" id="Page_345a"></a>&sect; <span class=
"smcap">xii.</span> "But consider now whether I have not spoken too
long." Then Timon said, "Perhaps you have, considering <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>what
remains and the time it will take. For now I am going to start the
last question, as if it were a combatant in reserve, since the
other two questions have been debated sufficiently. For as to the
charge and bold accusation that Euripides brings against the gods,
for visiting the sins of the parents upon the children, consider
that even those of us who are silent agree with Euripides. For if
the guilty were punished themselves there would be no further need
to punish the innocent, for it is not fair to punish even the
guilty twice for the same offence, whereas if the gods through
easiness remit the punishment of the wicked, and exact it later on
from the innocent, they do not well to compensate for their
tardiness by injustice. Such conduct resembles the story told of
&AElig;sop's coming to this very spot,<a name="FNanchor_837_837"
id="FNanchor_837_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_837" class=
"fnanchor">837</a> with money from Cr&oelig;sus, to offer a
splendid sacrifice to the god, and to give four min&aelig; to each
of the Delphians. And some quarrel or difference belike ensuing
between him and the Delphians here, he offered the sacrifice, but
sent the money back to Sardis, as though the Delphians were not
worthy to receive that benefit, so they fabricated against him a
charge of sacrilege, and put him to death by throwing him headlong
down yonder rock called Hyampia. And in consequence the god is said
to have been wroth with them, and to have brought dearth on their
land, and all kinds of strange diseases, so that they went round at
the public festivals of the Greeks, and invited by proclamation
whoever wished to take satisfaction of them for &AElig;sop's death.
And three generations afterwards came Idmon<a name=

of &AElig;sop's, but a descendant of those who had purchased
&AElig;sop as a slave at Samos, and by giving him satisfaction the
Delphians got rid of their trouble. And it was in consequence of
this, they say, that the punishment of those guilty of sacrilege
was transferred from Hyampia to Nauplia.<a name="FNanchor_839_839"

unreasonable, if we continue to show favour to a virtuous stock, to

should not correspond with the adequate reward of merit. And he
that is glad to see the descendants of Cimon honoured at Athens,
but is displeased and indignant that the descendants of Lachares or
Aristo are in exile, is too soft and easy, or rather too
fault-finding and peevish with the gods, accusing them if the

them also if the progeny of the bad are wiped off the face of the
earth; thus finding fault with the deity alike, whether the

the track to what is probable and plausible, for certainty and
truth are things very difficult to find even in every-day life. For

consumption or dropsy bidden to sit with their feet in water till
the dead body is burnt? For that is thought to prevent the disease
transferring itself to them. Again, when a she-goat takes a bit of
eringo into her mouth, why do the whole herd stand still, till the
goatherd comes up and takes it out of her mouth? There are other
properties that have connection and communication, and that
transfer themselves from one thing to another with incredible<a

immense distances. But we marvel more at intervals of time than

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> "Moreover the public
punishments of cities by the gods admits of a just defence. For a
city is one continuous entity, a sort of creature that never
changes from age, or becomes different by time, but is ever
sympathetic with and conformable to itself, and is answerable for
whatever it does or has done for the public weal, as long as the
community by its union and federal bonds preserves its unity. For
he that would make several, or rather any quantity of, cities out
of one by process of time would be like a person who made one human
being several, by regarding him now as an old man, now as a young
man, now as a stripling. Or rather this kind of reasoning resembles
the arguments of Epicharmus, from whom the sophists borrowed the
piled-up method of reasoning,<a name="FNanchor_851_851" id=
"FNanchor_851_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_851" class=
"fnanchor">851</a> for example, he incurred the debt long ago, so
he does not owe it now, being a different person, or, he was
invited to dinner yesterday, but he comes uninvited to-day, for he
is another person. And yet age produces greater changes in any
individual than it does commonly in cities. For any one would
recognize Athens again if he had not seen it for thirty years, for
the present habits and feelings of the people there, their
business, amusements, likes and dislikes, are just what they were
long ago; whereas a man's friend or acquaintance meeting him after
some time would hardly recognize his appearance, for the change of
character easily introduced by every thought and deed, feeling and
custom, produce a wonderful strangeness and novelty in the same
person. And yet a man is reckoned to be the same person from birth
to death, and similarly we think it right for a city always
remaining the same to be liable to reproach for the ill deeds of
its former inhabitants, on the same principle as it enjoys its
ancient glory and power; or shall we, without being aware of it,
throw everything into Heraclitus' river, into which he says a
person cannot step twice,<a name="FNanchor_852_852" id=
"FNanchor_852_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_852" class=

everything?"</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id=

then a city is one continuous entity, so of course is a race that
starts from one beginning, that can trace back intimate union and
similarity of faculties, for that which is begot is not, like some
production of art, unlike the begetter, for it proceeds from him,
and is not merely produced by him, so that it appropriately
receives his share, whether that be honour or punishment. And if I
should not seem to be trifling, I should say that the bronze statue
of Cassander melted down by the Athenians, and the body of
Dionysius thrown out of their territory by the Syracusans after his
death, were treated more unjustly than punishing their posterity
would have been. For there was none of the nature of Cassander in
the statue, and the soul of Dionysius had left his dead body before
this outrage, whereas Nys&aelig;us and Apollocrates,<a name=
"FNanchor_853_853" id="FNanchor_853_853"></a><a href=

other sons of wicked parents had innate in them a good deal of
their fathers, and that no listless or inactive element, but one by
which they lived and were nourished, and by which their ideas were
controlled. Nor is it at all strange or absurd that some should
have their fathers' characteristics. And to speak generally, as in
surgery whatever is useful is also just, and that person would be
ridiculous who should say it was unjust to cauterize the thumb when
the hip-joints were in pain, and to lance the stomach when the
liver was inflamed, or when oxen were tender in their hoofs to
anoint the tips of their horns, so he that looks for any other
justice in punishment than curing vice, and is dissatisfied if
surgery is employed to one part to benefit another, as surgeons
open a vein to relieve ophthalmia, can see nothing beyond the
evidence of the senses, and does not remember that even a
schoolmaster by correcting one lad admonishes others, and that by
decimation a general makes his whole army obey. And so not only by
one part to another comes benefit, but also to the soul through the
soul, even more often than to the body through the body, come
certain dispositions, and vices or improvement of character. For
just as it is likely in the case of the body that the same feelings
and changes will take place, so the soul, being worked upon by
fancies, naturally <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352"
id="Page_352">352</a></span>becomes better or worse according as it has more
confidence or fear."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvii.</span> While I was thus
speaking, Olympicus interposed, and said, "You seem in your
argument to assume the important assumption of the permanence of
the soul." I replied, "You too concede it, or rather did concede
it. For that the deity deals with everyone according to his merit
has been the assumption of our argument from the beginning." Then
said he, "Do you think that it follows, because the gods notice our
actions and deal with us accordingly, that souls are either
altogether imperishable, or for some time survive dissolution?"
Then said I, "Not exactly so, my good sir, but is the deity so
little and so attached to trifles, if we have nothing divine in
ourselves, nothing resembling him, nothing lasting or sure, but
that we all do fade as a leaf, as Homer<a name="FNanchor_855_855"

the souls of the dead perish immediately, and glide out of their
bodies like mist or smoke, he would enjoin many propitiatory
offerings for the departed and honours for the dead, merely
cheating and beguiling those that believed in him? For my own part,
I shall never abandon my belief in the permanence of the soul,
unless some second Hercules<a name="FNanchor_859_859" id=
"FNanchor_859_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_859" class=
"fnanchor">859</a> shall come and take away the tripod of the
Pythian Priestess, and abolish and destroy the oracle. For as long
as many such oracles are still given, as was said to be given to
Corax of Naxos formerly, it is impious to declare that the soul
dies." Then said Patrocleas, "What oracle do you refer to? Who was
this Corax? To me both the occurrence and name are quite strange."
"That cannot be," said <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id=
"Page_353">353</a></span>I, "but I am to blame for using the
surname instead of the name. For he that killed Archilochus in
battle was called Calondes, it seems, but his surname was Corax. He
was first rejected by the Pythian Priestess, as having slain a man
sacred to the Muses, but after using many entreaties and prayers,
and urging pleas in defence of his act, he was ordered to go to the
dwelling of Tettix, and appease the soul of Archilochus. Now this
place was T&aelig;narum, for there they say Tettix the Cretan had
gone with a fleet and founded a city, and dwelt near the place
where departed souls were conjured up. Similarly also, when the
Spartans were bidden by the oracle to appease the soul of
Pausanias, the necromancers were summoned from Italy, and, after
they had offered sacrifice, they got the ghost out of the
temple."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xviii.</span> "It is one and the same
argument," I continued, "that confirms the providence of the deity
and the permanence of the soul of man, so that you cannot leave one
if you take away the other. And if the soul survives after death,
it makes the probability stronger that rewards or punishments will
be assigned to it. For during life the soul struggles, like an
athlete, and when the struggle is over, then it gets its deserts.
But what rewards or punishments the soul gets when by itself in the
unseen world for the deeds done in the body has nothing to do with
us that are alive, and is perhaps not credited by us, and certainly
unknown to us; whereas those punishments that come on descendants
and on the race are evident to all that are alive, and deter and
keep back many from wickedness. For there is no more disgraceful or
bitter punishment than to see our children in misfortune through
our faults, and if the soul of an impious or lawless man could see
after death, not his statues or honours taken from him, but his
children or friends or race in great adversity owing to him, and
paying the penalty for his misdeeds, no one would ever persuade
him, could he come to life again, to be unjust and licentious, even
for the honours of Zeus. I could tell you a story on this head,
which I recently heard, but I hesitate to do so, lest you should
regard it only as a myth; I confine myself therefore to
probability." "Pray don't," said Olympicus, "let us have your
story." And as the others made<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span> the same request, I said,
"Permit me first to finish my discourse according to probability,
and then, if you like, I will set my myth a going, if it is a
myth.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xix.</span> Bion says the deity in
punishing the children of the wicked for their fathers' crimes is
more ridiculous than a doctor administering a potion to a son or
grandson for a father's or grandfather's disease. But the cases,
though in some respects similar and like, are in others dissimilar.
For to cure one person of a disease does not cure another, nor is
one any better, when suffering from ophthalmia or fever, by seeing
another anointed or poulticed. But the punishments of evil-doers
are exhibited to everybody for this reason, that it is the function
of justice, when it is carried out as reason dictates, to check
some by the punishment of others. So that Bion did not see in what
respect his comparison touched our subject. For sometimes, when a
man falls into a grievous but not incurable malady, which
afterwards by intemperance and negligence ruins his constitution
and kills him, is not his son, who is not supposed to be suffering
from the same malady but only to have a predisposition for it,
enjoined to a careful manner of living by his medical man, or
friend, or intelligent trainer in gymnastics, or honest guardian,
and recommended to abstain from fish and pastry, wine and women,
and to take medicine frequently, and to go in for training in the
gymnasiums, and so to dissipate and get rid of the small seeds of
what might be a serious malady, if he allowed it to come to a head?
Do we not indeed give advice of this kind to the children of
diseased fathers or mothers, bidding them take care and be cautious
and not to neglect themselves, but at once to arrest the first
germ, of the malady, nipping it in the bud while removable, and
before it has got a firm footing in the constitution?" "Certainly
we do," said all the company. "We are not then," I continued,
"acting in a strange or ridiculous but in a necessary and useful
way, in arranging their exercise and food and physic for the sons
of epileptic or atrabilious or gouty people, not when they are ill,
but to prevent their becoming so. For the offspring of a poor
constitution does not require punishment, but it does require
medical treatment and care, and if any one stigmatizes this,
because it curtails pleasure and involves some self-denial<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span> and
pain, as a punishment inflicted by cowardice and timidity, we care
not for his opinion. Can it be right to tend and care for the body
that has an hereditary predisposition to some malady, and are we to
neglect the growth and spread in the young character of hereditary
taint of vice, and to dally with it, and wait till it be plainly
mixed up with the feelings, and, to use the language of Pindar,
"produce malignant fruit in the heart?"</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xx.</span> Or is the deity in this
respect no wiser than Hesiod, who exhorts and advises, "not to
beget children on our return from a sad funeral, but after a
banquet with the gods,"<a name="FNanchor_860_860" id=
"FNanchor_860_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_860" class=
"fnanchor">860</a> as though not vice or virtue only, but sorrow or
joy and all other propensities, came from generation, to which the
poet bids us come gay and agreeable and sprightly. But it is not
Hesiod's function, or the work of human wisdom, but it belongs to
the deity, to discern and accurately distinguish similarities and
differences of character, before they become obvious by resulting
in crime through the influence of the passions. For the young of
bears and wolves and apes manifest from their birth the nature
innate in them in all its naked simplicity; whereas mankind, under
the influence of customs and opinions and laws, frequently conceal
their bad qualities and imitate what is good, so as altogether to
obliterate and escape from the innate taint of vice, or to be
undetected for a long time, throwing the veil of craft round their
real nature, so that we are scarce conscious of their villainy till
we feel the blow or smart of some unjust action, so that we are in
fact only aware that there is such a thing as injustice when men
act unjustly, or as vice when men act viciously, or as cowardice
when men run away, just as if one were to suppose that scorpions
had a sting only when they stung us, or that vipers were venomous
only when they bit us, which would be a very silly idea. For every
bad man is not bad only when he breaks out into crime, but he has
the seeds of vice in his nature, and is only vicious in act when he
has opportunity and means, as opportunity makes the thief steal,<a
name="FNanchor_861_861" id="FNanchor_861_861"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_861_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> and the tyrant violate
the laws. But the deity is <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356"
id="Page_356">356</a></span>not ignorant of the nature and
disposition of every man, inasmuch as by his very nature he can
read the soul better than the body, and does not wait to punish
violence in the act, or shamelessness in the tongue, or
lasciviousness in the members. For he does not retaliate upon the
wrong-doer as having been ill-treated by him, nor is he angry with
the robber as having been plundered by him, nor does he hate the
adulterer as having himself suffered from his licentiousness, but
it is to cure him that he often punishes the adulterous or
avaricious or unjust man in embryo, before he has had time to work
out all his villainy, as we try to stop epileptic fits before they
come on.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxi.</span> Just now we were
dissatisfied that the wicked were punished late and tardily,
whereas at present we find fault with the deity for correcting the
character and disposition of same before they commit crime, from
our ignoring that the future deed may be worse and more dreadful
than the past, and the hidden intention than the overt act; for we
are not able fully to understand the reasons why it is better to
leave some alone in their ill deeds, and to arrest others in the
intention; just as no doubt medicine is not appropriate in the case
of some patients, which would be beneficial to others not ill, but
yet perhaps in a more dangerous condition still. And so the gods do
not visit all the offences of parents on their children, but if a
good man is the son of a bad one, as the son of a sickly parent is
sometimes of a good constitution, he is exempt from the punishment
of his race, as not being a participator in its viciousness. But if
a young man imitates his vicious race it is only right that he
should inherit the punishment of their ill deeds, as he would their
debts. For Antigonus was not punished for Demetrius, nor, of the
old heroes,<a name="FNanchor_862_862" id="FNanchor_862_862"></a><a
href="#Footnote_862_862" class="fnanchor">862</a> Phyleus for
Augeas, or Nestor for Neleus, for though their sires were bad they
were good, but those whose nature liked and approved the vices of
their ancestors, these justice punished, taking vengeance on their
similarity in viciousness. For as the warts and moles and freckles
of parents often skip a generation, and reappear in the grandsons
and granddaughters, and as a Greek woman, <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>that had a black baby
and so was accused of adultery, found out that she was the great
granddaughter of an Ethiopian,<a name="FNanchor_863_863" id=
"FNanchor_863_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863_863" class=
"fnanchor">863</a> and as the son of Pytho the Nisibian who
recently died, and who was said to trace his descent to the
Sparti,<a name="FNanchor_864_864" id="FNanchor_864_864"></a><a
href="#Footnote_864_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> had the birthmark
on his body of the print of a spear the token of his race, which
though long dormant had come up again as out of the deep, so
frequently earlier generations conceal and suppress the mental
idiosyncrasies and passions of their race, which afterwards nature
causes to break out in other members of the family, and so displays
the family bent either to vice or virtue."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xxii.</span> When I had said thus
much I was silent, but Olympicus smiled and said, "We do not praise
you, lest we should seem to forget your promised story, as though
what you had advanced was adequate proof enough, but we will give
our opinion when we have heard it." Then I began as follows.
"Thespesius of Soli, an intimate friend of that Protogenes<a name=
"FNanchor_865_865" id="FNanchor_865_865"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_865_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> who lived in this city
with us for some time, had been very profligate during the early
part of his life, and had quickly run through his property, and for
some time owing to his straits had given himself up to bad
practices, when repenting of his old ways, and following the
pursuit of riches, he resembled those profligate husbands that pay
no attention to their wives while they live with them, but get rid
of them, and then, after they have married other men, do all they
can wickedly to seduce them. Abstaining then from nothing
dishonourable that could bring either enjoyment or gain, in no long
time he got together no great amount of property, but a very great
reputation for villainy. But what most damaged his character was
the answer he received from the oracle of Amphilochus.<a name=
"FNanchor_866_866" id="FNanchor_866_866"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_866_866" class="fnanchor">866</a> For he sent it seems a
messenger to consult the god whether he would live the rest of his
life better, and the answer was he would do better after his death.
And indeed this happened in a sense not long after. For he fell
headlong down from a great height, and though he had received no
wound <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id=
"Page_358">358</a></span>nor even a blow, the fall did for him, but
three days after (just as he was about to be buried) he recovered.
He soon picked up his strength again, and went home, and so changed
his manner of life that people would hardly credit it. For the
Cilicians say that they know nobody who was in those days more
fairdealing in business, or more devout to the deity, or more
disagreeable to his enemies, or more faithful to his friends;
insomuch that all who had any dealings with him desired to hear the
reason of this change, not thinking that so great a reformation of
character could have proceeded from chance, and their idea was
correct, as his narrative to Protogenes and others of his great
friends showed. For he told them that, when his soul left the body,
the change he first underwent was as if he were a pilot thrown
violently into the sea out of a ship. Then raising himself up a
little, he thought he recovered the power of breathing again
altogether, and looked round him in every direction, as if one eye
of the soul was open. But he saw none of the things he had ever
seen before, but stars enormous in size and at immense distance
from one another, sending forth a wonderful and intense brightness
of colour, so that the soul was borne along and moved about
everywhere quickly and easily, like a ship is fair weather. But
omitting most of the sights he saw, he said that the souls of the
dead mounted into the air, which yielded to them and formed fiery
bubbles, and then, when each bubble quietly broke, they assumed
human forms, light in weight but with different kinds of motion,
for some leapt about with wonderful agility and darted straight
upwards, while others like spindles flitted round all together in a
circle, some in an upward direction, some in a downward, with mixed
and confused motion, hardly stopping at all, or only after a very
long time. As to most of these he was ignorant who they were, but
he saw two or three that he knew, and tried to approach them and
talk with them, but they would not listen to him, and did not seem
to be in their right minds, but out of their senses and distraught,
avoiding every sight and touch, and at first turned round and round
alone, but afterwards meeting many other souls whirling round and
in the same condition as themselves, they moved about promiscuously
with no particular object in view, and uttered<span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
inarticulate sounds, like yells, mixed with wailing and terror.
Other souls in the upper part of the air seemed joyful, and
frequently approached one another in a friendly way, and avoided
those troubled souls, and seemed to mark their displeasure by
keeping themselves to themselves, and their joy and delight by
extension and expansion. At last he said he saw the soul of a
relation, that he thought he knew but was not quite sure, as he
died when he was a boy, which came up to him and said to him,
"Welcome, Thespesius." And he wondering, and saying that his name
was not Thespesius but Arid&aelig;us, the soul replied, "That was
your old name, but henceforth it will be Thespesius. For assuredly
you are not dead, but by the will of the gods are come here with
your intellect, for the rest of your soul you have left in the body
like an anchor; and as a proof of what I say both now and hereafter
notice that the souls of the dead have no shadow and do not move
their eyelids." Thespesius, on hearing these words, pulled himself
somewhat more together again, and began to use his reason, and
looking more closely he noticed that an indistinct and shadow-like
line was suspended over him, while the others shone all round and
were transparent, but were not all alike; for some were like the
full-moon at its brightest, throwing out one smooth even and
continuous colour, others had spots or light marks here and there,
while others were quite variegated and strange to the sight, with
black spots like snakes, while others again had dim scratches.</p>

<p>Then the kinsman of Thespesius (for there is nothing to prevent
our calling the souls by the name of the persons), pointed out
everything, and told him that Adrastea, the daughter of Necessity
and Zeus, was placed in the highest position to punish all crimes,
and no criminal was either so great or so small as to be able to
escape her either by fraud or violence. But, as there were three
kinds of punishment, each had its own officer and administering
functionary. "For speedy Vengeance undertakes the punishment of
those that are to be corrected at once in the body and through
their bodies, and she mildly passes by many offences that only need
expiation; but if the cure of vice demands further pains, then the
deity hands over such criminals after death to Justice, and those
whom Justice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_360" id=
"Page_360">360</a></span> rejects as altogether incurable, Erinnys
(the third and fiercest of Adrastea's officers), pursues as they
are fleeing and wandering about in various directions, and with
pitiless severity utterly undoes them all, and thrusts them down to
a place not to be seen or spoken about. And, of all these
punishments, that which is administered in this life by Vengeance
is most like those in use among the barbarians. For as among the
Persians they pluck off and scourge the garments and tiaras of
those that are to be punished, while the offenders weep and beg
them to cease, so most punishments by fine or bodily chastisement
have no sharp touch, nor do they reach vice itself, but are only
for show and sentiment. And whoever goes from this world to that
incorrigible and impure, Justice takes him aside, naked as he is in
soul, and unable to veil or hide or conceal his villainy, but
descried all round and in all points by everybody, and shows him
first to his good parents, if such they were, to let them see what
a wretch he is and how unworthy of his ancestors; but if they were
wicked too, seeing them punished and himself being seen by them, he
is chastised for a long time till he is purged of each of his bad
propensities by sufferings and pains, which as much exceed in
magnitude and intensity all sufferings in the flesh, as what is
real is more vivid than a dream. But the scars and marks of the
stripes for each bad propensity are more visible in some than in
others. Observe also, he continued, the different and various
colours of the souls. That dark dirty-brown colour is the pigment
of illiberality and covetousness, and the blood-red the sign of
cruelty and savageness, and where the blue is there sensuality and
love of pleasure are not easily eradicated, and that violet and
livid colour marks malice and envy, like the dark liquid ejected by
the cuttle fish. For as during life vice produces these colours by
the soul being acted upon by passions and reacting upon the body,
so here it is the end of purification and correction when they are
toned down, and the soul becomes altogether bright and one colour.
But as long as these colours remain, there are relapses of the
passions accompanied by palpitation and throbbing of the heart, in
some faint and soon suppressed, in others more violent and lasting.
And some of these souls by being again and again corrected<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
recover their proper disposition and condition, while others again
by their violent ignorance and excessive love of pleasure<a name=
"FNanchor_867_867" id="FNanchor_867_867"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_867_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> are carried into the
bodies of animals; for one by weakness of reasoning power, and
slowness of contemplation, is impelled by the practical element in
him to generation, while another, lacking an instrument to satisfy
his licentiousness, desires to gratify his passions immediately,
and to get that gratification through the medium of the body; for
here there is no real fruition, but only an imperfect shadow and
dream of incomplete pleasure."</p>

<p>After he had said this, Thespesius' kinsman hurried him at great
speed through immense space, as it seemed to him, though he
travelled as easily and straight as if he were carried on the wings
of the sun's rays. At last he got to an extensive and bottomless
abyss, where his strength left him, as he found was the case with
the other souls there: for keeping together and making swoops, like
birds, they flitted all round the abyss, but did not venture to
pass over it. To internal view it resembled the caverns of Bacchus,
being beautiful throughout<a name="FNanchor_868_868" id=
"FNanchor_868_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868_868" class=
"fnanchor">868</a> with trees and green foliage and flowers of all
kinds, and it breathed a soft and gentle air, laden with scents
marvellously pleasant, and producing the effect that wine does on
those who are topers; for the souls were elevated by its fragrance,
and gay and blithe with one another: and the whole spot was full of
mirth and laughter, and such songs as emanate from gaiety and
enjoyment. And Thespesius' kinsman told him that this was the way
Dionysus went up to heaven by, and by which he afterwards took up
Semele, and it was called the place of Oblivion. But he would not
let Thespesius stay there, much as he wished, but forcibly dragged
him away, instructing and telling him that the intellect was melted
and moistened by pleasure, and that the irrational and corporeal
element being watered and made flesh stirs up the memory of the
body, from which comes a yearning and strong desire for generation,
so called from being an inclination to the earth,<a name=
"FNanchor_869_869" id="FNanchor_869_869"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_869_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> when the soul is
weighed down with moisture.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id=
"Page_362">362</a></span>Next Thespesius travelled as far in
another direction, and seemed to see a great crater into which
several rivers emptied themselves, one whiter than the foam of the
sea or snow, another like the purple of the rainbow, and others of
various hues whose brightness was apparent at some distance, but
when he got nearer the air became thinner and the colours grew dim,
and the crater lost all its gay colours but white. And he saw three
genii sitting together in a triangular position, mixing the rivers
together in certain proportions. Then the guide of Thespesius' soul
told him, that Orpheus got as far as here, when he came in quest of
the soul of his wife,<a name="FNanchor_870_870" id=
"FNanchor_870_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870_870" class=
"fnanchor">870</a> and from not exactly remembering what he had
seen spread a false report among mankind, that the oracle at Delphi
was common to Apollo and Night, though Apollo had no communion with
Night: but this, pursued the guide, is an oracle common to Night
and the Moon, that utters forth its oracular knowledge in no
particular part of the world, nor has it any particular seat, but
wanders about everywhere in men's dreams and visions. Hence, as you
see, dreams receive and disseminate a mixture<a name=
"FNanchor_871_871" id="FNanchor_871_871"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_871_871" class="fnanchor">871</a> of simple truth with
deceit and error. But the oracle of Apollo you do not know, nor can
you see it, for the earthiness of the soul does not suffer it to
soar upwards, but keeps it down in dependence on the body. And
taking him nearer his guide tried to show him the light from the
tripod, which, as he said, shone as far as Parnassus through the
bosom of Themis, but though he desired to see it he could not for
its brightness, but as he passed by he heard the shrill voice of a
woman speaking in verse several things, among others, he thought,
telling the time of his death. That, said the genius, was the voice
of the Sibyl, who sang about the future as she was being borne
about in the Orb of the moon. Though desirous then to hear more, he
was conveyed into another direction by the violent motion of the
moon, as if he had been in the eddies of a whirlpool, so that he
heard very little more, only a prophecy about Mt. Vesuvius and that
Dic&aelig;archia<a name="FNanchor_872_872" id=

about the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id=

"FNanchor_873_873" id="FNanchor_873_873"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_873_873" class="fnanchor">873</a> that "though he was
good he would lose his empire through sickness."</p>

<p>After this Thespesius and his guide turned to see those that
were undergoing punishment. And at first they saw only distressing
and pitiable sights, but after that, Thespesius, little expecting
it, found himself among his friends and acquaintances and kinsfolk
who were being punished, and undergoing dreadful sufferings and
hideous and bitter tortures, and who wept and wailed to him. And at
last he descried his father coming up out of a certain gulf covered
with marks and scars, stretching out his hands, and not allowed to
keep silence, but compelled by those that presided over his torture
to confess that he had been an accursed wretch and poisoned some
strangers that had gold, and during his lifetime had escaped the
detection of everybody; but had been found out here, and his guilt
brought home to him, for which he had already suffered much, and
was being dragged on to suffer more. So great was his consternation
and fear that he did not dare to intercede or beg for his father's
release, but wishing to turn and flee he could no longer see his
gentle and kind guide, but he was thrust forward by some persons
horrible to look at, as if some dire necessity compelled him to go
through with the business, and saw that the shades of those that
had been notorious criminals and punished in their life-time were
not so severely tortured here or like the others, but had an
incomplete<a name="FNanchor_874_874" id="FNanchor_874_874"></a><a
href="#Footnote_874_874" class="fnanchor">874</a> though toilsome
punishment for their irrational passions.<a name="FNanchor_875_875"
id="FNanchor_875_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875_875" class=
"fnanchor">875</a> Whereas those who under the mask and show of
virtue had lived all their lives in undetected vice were forced by
their torturers with labour and pain to turn their souls inside
out, unnaturally wriggling and writhing about, like the
sea-scolopendras who, when they have swallowed the hook, turn
themselves inside out; but some of them their torturers flayed and
crimped so as to show their various inward vices which were only
skinned over, which were deep in their soul the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>principal
part of man. And he said he saw other souls, like snakes two or
three or even more twined together, devouring one another in
malignity and malevolence for what they had suffered or done in
life. He said also that there were several lakes running parallel,
one of boiling gold, another most cold of lead, another hard of
iron, and several demons were standing by, like smiths, who lowered
down and drew up by turns with instruments the souls of those whose
criminality lay in insatiable cupidity. For when they were red-hot
and transparent through their bath in the lake of gold, the demons
thrust them into the lake of lead and dipped them in that; and when
they got congealed in it and hard as hail, they dipped them into
the lake of iron, and there they became wonderfully black, and
broken and crushed by the hardness of the iron, and changed their
appearance, and after that they were dipped again in the lake of
gold, after suffering, he said, dreadful agony in all these changes
of torment. But he said those souls suffered most piteously of all
that, when they seemed to have escaped justice, were arrested
again, and these were those whose crimes had been visited on their
children or descendants. For whenever one of these latter happened
to come up, he fell into a rage and cried out, and showed the marks
of what he had suffered, and upbraided and pursued the soul of the
parent, that wished to fly and hide himself but could not. For
quickly did the ministers of torture pursue them, and hurry them
back again to Justice,<a name="FNanchor_876_876" id=
"FNanchor_876_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876_876" class=
"fnanchor">876</a> wailing all the while on account of their
fore-knowledge of what their punishment would be. And to some of
them he said many of their posterity clung at once, and just like
bees or bats stuck to them, and squeaked and gibbered<a name=
"FNanchor_877_877" id="FNanchor_877_877"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_877_877" class="fnanchor">877</a> in their rage at the
memory of what they had suffered owing to them. Last of all he saw
the souls of those that were to come into the world a second time,
forcibly moulded and transformed into various kinds of animals by
artificers appointed for the very purpose with instruments and
blows, who broke off all the limbs of some, and only wrenched off
some of others, and polished others down or <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id=
"Page_365">365</a></span>annihilated them altogether, to fit them
for other habits and modes of life. Among them he saw the soul of
Nero tortured in other ways, and pierced with red-hot nails. And
the artificers having taken it in hand and converted it into the
semblance of a Pindaric viper, which gets its way to life by
gnawing through its mother's womb, a great light, he said, suddenly
shone, and a voice came out of the light, ordering them to change
it into something milder, so they devised of it the animal that
croaks about lakes and marshes, for he had been punished
sufficiently for his crimes, and now deserved some favour at the
hands of the gods, for he had freed Greece, the noblest nation of
his subjects and the best-beloved of the gods.<a name=

"#Footnote_878_878" class="fnanchor">878</a> So much did Thespesius
behold, but as he intended to return a horrible dread came upon
him. For a woman, marvellous in appearance and size, took hold of
him and said to him, "Come here that you may the better remember
everything you have seen." And she was about to strike him with a
red-hot iron pin, such as the encaustic painters use,<a name=

that he was close to his tomb.</p>

<h3>AGAINST BORROWING MONEY<a name="Page_365a" id=
"Page_365a" />.</h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> Plato in his Laws<a name=
"FNanchor_881_881" id="FNanchor_881_881"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_881_881" class="fnanchor">881</a> does not permit
neighbours to use one another's water, unless they have first dug
for themselves as far as the clay, and reached ground that is
unsuitable for a well. For clay, having a rich and compact nature,
absorbs the water it receives, and does not let it pass through.
But he allows people that cannot make a well of their own to use
their neighbour's water, for the law ought to relieve necessity.
Ought there not also to <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366"
id="Page_366">366</a></span>be a law about money, that people
should not borrow of others, nor go to other people's sources of
income, until they have first examined their own resources at home,
and collected, as by drops, what is necessary for their use? But
nowadays from luxury and effeminacy and lavish expenditure people
do not use their own resources, though they have them, but borrow
from others at great interest without necessity. And what proves
this very clearly is the fact that people do not lend money to the
needy, but only to those who, wanting an immediate supply, bring a
witness and adequate security for their credit, so that they can be
in no actual necessity of borrowing.<a name="FNanchor_882_882" id=
"FNanchor_882_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882_882" class=
"fnanchor">882</a></p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> Why pay court to the
banker or trader? Borrow from your own table. You have cups, silver
dishes, pots and pans. Use them in your need. Beautiful Aulis or
Tenedos will furnish you with earthenware instead, purer than
silver, for they will not smell strongly and unpleasantly of
interest, a kind of rust that daily soils your sumptuousness, nor
will they remind you of the calends and the new moon, which, though
the most holy of days, the money-lenders make ill-omened and
hateful. For those who instead of selling them put their goods out
at pawn cannot be saved even by Zeus the Protector of Property:
they are ashamed to sell, they are not ashamed to pay interest on
their goods when out at pawn. And yet the famous Pericles made the
ornament of Athene, which weighed forty talents of fine gold,
removable at will, for "so," he said, "we can use the gold in war,
and at some other time restore as costly a one." So should we too
in our necessities, as in a siege, not receive a garrison imposed
on us by a hostile money-lender, nor allow our goods to go into
slavery; but stripping our table, our bed, our carriages, and our
diet, of superfluities, we should keep ourselves free, intending to
restore all those things again, if we have good luck.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> So the Roman matrons
offered their gold and ornaments as first-fruits to Pythian Apollo,
out of which a golden cup was made and sent to Delphi;<a name=
"FNanchor_883_883" id="FNanchor_883_883"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_883_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> and the Carthaginian
matrons had their heads shorn, and with the <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>hair cut
off made cords for the machines and engines to be used in defence
of their country.<a name="FNanchor_884_884" id=
"FNanchor_884_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884_884" class=
"fnanchor">884</a> But we being ashamed of independence enslave
ourselves to covenants and conditions, when we ought to restrict
and confine ourselves to what is useful, and dock or sell useless
superfluities, to build a temple of liberty for ourselves, our
wives, and children. The famous Artemis at Ephesus gives asylum and
security from their creditors to debtors, when they take refuge in
her temple; but the asylum and sanctuary of frugality is everywhere
open to the sober-minded, affording them joyful and honourable and
ample space for much ease. For as the Pythian Priestess told the
Athenians at the time of the Median war that the god had given them
wooden walls,<a name="FNanchor_885_885" id=
"FNanchor_885_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885_885" class=
"fnanchor">885</a> and they left the region and city, their goods
and houses, and took refuge in their ships for liberty, so the god
gives us a wooden table, and earthenware plate, and coarse
garments, if we wish to live free. Care not for fine horses or
chariots with handsome harness, adorned with gold<a name=
"FNanchor_886_886" id="FNanchor_886_886"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_886_886" class="fnanchor">886</a> and silver, which
swift interest will catch up and outrun, but mounted on any chance
donkey or nag flee from the hostile and tyrannical money-lender,
not demanding like the Mede land and water,<a name=
"FNanchor_887_887" id="FNanchor_887_887"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_887_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> but interfering with
your liberty, and lowering your status. If you pay him not, he duns
you; if you offer the money, he won't have it; if you are selling
anything, he cheapens the price; if you don't want to sell, he
forces you; if you sue him, he comes to terms with you; if you
swear, he hectors; if you go to his house, he shuts the door in
your face; whereas if you stay at home, he billets himself on you,
and is ever rapping at your door.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> How did Solon benefit the
Athenians by ordaining that debtors should no longer have to pay in
person? For they are slaves to all money-lenders,<a name=
"FNanchor_888_888" id="FNanchor_888_888"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_888_888" class="fnanchor">888</a> and not to them only,
what would there be so monstrous in that? but to their <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>slaves,
who are insolent and savage barbarians, such as Plato represents
the fiery torturers and executioners in Hades who preside over the
punishment of the impious. For they make the forum a hell for
wretched debtors, and like vultures devour and rend them limb from
limb, "piercing into their bowels,"<a name="FNanchor_889_889" id=
"FNanchor_889_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889_889" class=
"fnanchor">889</a> and stand over others and prevent their tasting
their own grapes or crops, as if they were so many Tantaluses. And
as Darius sent Datis and Artaphernes to Athens with manacles and
chains in their hands for their captives, so they bring into Greece
boxes full of bonds and agreements, like fetters, and visit the
towns and scour the country round, sowing not like Triptolemus
harmless corn, but planting the toilsome and prolific and
never-ending roots of debts, which grow and spread all round, and
ruin and choke cities. They say that hares at once give birth and
suckle and conceive again, but the debts of these knaves and
barbarians give birth before they conceive; for at the very moment
of giving they ask back, and take up what they laid down, and lend
what they take for lending.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> It is a saying among the
Messenians, that "there is a Pylos before Pylos, and another Pylos
too." So it may be said with respect to these money-lenders, "there
is interest before interest, and other interest too." Then of
course they laugh at those natural philosophers who say that
nothing can come of nothing, for they get interest on what neither
is nor was; and they think it disgraceful to farm out the taxes,
though the law allows it, while they themselves against the law
exact tribute for what they lend, or rather, if one is to say the
truth, defraud as they lend, for he who receives less than he signs
his name for is defrauded. The Persians indeed think lying a
secondary crime, but debt a principal one, for lying frequently
follows upon debt, but money-lenders tell more lies, for they make
fraudulent entries in their account-books, writing down that they
have given so-and-so so much, when they have really given less. And
the only excuse for their lying is covetousness, not necessity, not
utter poverty, but insatiable greediness, the outcome of which is
without enjoyment and useless to <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>themselves, and fatal to
their victims. For neither do they farm the fields which they rob
their debtors of, nor do they inhabit their houses when they have
thrust them out, nor use their tables or apparel, but first one is
ruined, and then a second is hunted down, for whom the first one
serves as a decoy. For the bane spreads and grows like a fire, to
the destruction and ruin of all who fall into their clutches, for
it consumes one after another; and the money-lender, who fans and
feeds this flame to ensnare many, gets no more advantage from it
but that some time after he can take his account-book and read how
many he has sold up, how many turned out of house and home, and
track the sources of his wealth, which is ever growing into a
larger pile.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> And do not think I say
this as an enemy proclaiming war against the money-lenders,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"For never did they lift my
cows or horses,"<a name="FNanchor_890_890" id=

</div>

<p>but merely to prove to those who too readily borrow money what
disgrace and servitude it brings with it, and what extreme folly
and weakness it is. Have you anything? do not borrow, for you are
not in a necessitous condition. Have you nothing? do not borrow,
for you will never be able to pay back. Let us consider either case
separately. Cato said to a certain old man who was a wicked fellow,
"My good sir, why do you add the shame that comes from wickedness
to old age, that has so many troubles of its own?" So too do you,
since poverty has so many troubles of its own, not add the terrible
distress that comes from borrowing money and from debt; and do not
take away from poverty its only advantage over wealth, its freedom
from corroding care. For the proverb that says, "I cannot carry a
goat, put an ox on my shoulder," has a ridiculous ring. Unable to
bear poverty, are you going to put on your back a money-lender, a
weight hard to carry even for a rich man? How then, will you say,
am I to maintain myself? Do you ask this, having two hands, two
legs, and a tongue, in short, being a man, to love and be loved, to
give and receive benefits? Can you not be a schoolmaster<span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span> or
tutor, or porter, or sailor, or make coasting voyages? Any of these
ways of getting a livelihood is less disgraceful and difficult than
to always have to hear, "Pay me that thou owest."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> The well-known Rutilius
went up to Musonius at Rome, and said to him, "Musonius, Zeus
Soter, whom you imitate and emulate, does not borrow money." And
Musonius smilingly answered, "Neither does he lend." For you must
know Rutilius, himself a lender, was bantering Musonius for being a
borrower. What Stoic inflatedness was all this! What need was there
to bring in Zeus Soter? For all nature teaches the same lesson.
Swallows do not borrow money, nor do ants, although nature has
given them no hands, or reason, or profession. But men have
intellect in excess, and so ingenious are they that they keep near
them horses, and dogs, and partridges, and jackdaws. Why then do
you despair, who are as impressible as a jackdaw, have as much
voice as a partridge, and are as noble as a dog, of getting some
person to befriend you, by looking after him, winning his
affections, guarding him, fighting his battles? Do you not see how
many opportunities there are both on land and sea? As Crates
says,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Miccylus and his wife, to
ward off famine</span> <span class="i0">In these bad times, I saw
both carding wool."</span></div>
</div>

<p>And King Antigonus asked Cleanthes, when he saw him at Athens
after a long interval, "Do you still grind, Cleanthes?" And he
replied, "I do, O king, but for my living, yet so as not to desert
philosophy." Such was the admirable spirit of the man who, coming
from the mill and kneading-trough, wrote with the hand that had
baked and ground about the gods, and the moon, and stars, and the
sun. But those kinds of labour are in our view servile! And so that
we may appear free we borrow money, and flatter and dance
attendance on slaves, and give them dinners and presents, and pay
taxes as it were to them, not on account of our poverty (for no one
lends money to a poor man), but from our love of lavish
expenditure. For if we were content with things necessary for
subsistence, the race of money-lenders would be as extinct as
Centaurs and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id=
"Page_371">371</a></span> Gorgons are; it is luxury that has
created them as much as goldsmiths, and silversmiths, and
perfumers, and dyers in bright colours. For we do not owe money for
bread and wine, but for estates, and slaves, and mules, and
dining-rooms, and tables, and for our lavish public entertainments,
in our unprofitable and thankless ambition. And he that is once
involved in debt remains in it all his time, like a horse bitted
and bridled that takes one rider after another, and there is no
escape to green pastures and meadows, but they wander about like
those demons who were driven out of heaven by the gods who are thus
described by Empedocles:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Into the sea the force of
heaven thrusts them,</span> <span class="i0">The sea rejects them
back upon the land;</span> <span class="i0">To the sun's rays th'
unresting earth remits them;</span> <span class="i0">The sun anon
whirls them to heaven again."</span></div>
</div>

<p>So one after another usurer or trader gets hold of the poor
wretch, hailing either from Corinth, or Patr&aelig;, or Athens,
till he gets set on to by them all, and torn to bits, and cut into
mince-meat as it were for his interest. For as a person who is
fallen into the mire must either get up out of it or remain in it,
and if he turns about in it, and wallows in it, and bedabbles his
body all over in it, he contracts only the greater defilement, so
by borrowing from one person to pay another and changing their
money-lenders they contract and incur fresh interest, and get into
greater liabilities, and closely resemble sufferers from cholera,
whose case does not admit of cure because they evacuate everything
they are ordered to take, and so ever add to the disease. So these
will not get cleansed from the disease of debt, but at regular
times in the year pay their interest with pain and agony, and then
immediately another creditor presents his little account, so again
their heads swim and ache, when they ought to have got rid of their
debts altogether, and regained their freedom.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> I now turn my attention
to those who are rich and luxurious, and use language like the
following, "Am I then to go without slaves and hearth and home?" As
if any dropsical person, whose body was greatly swollen and who was
very weak, should say to his doctor, "Am I then to become lean and
empty?" And why not, to get well?<span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span> And do you too go without a
slave, not to be a slave yourself; and without chattels, not to be
another man's chattel. Listen to a story about two vultures; one
was vomiting and saying it would bring its inside up, and the other
who was by said, "What harm if you do? For it won't be your inside
you bring up, but that dead body we devoured lately." And so any
debtor does not sell his own estate, or his own house, but his
creditor's, for he has made him by law master of them. Nay, but by
Zeus, says one, my father left me this field. Yes, and your father
also left you liberty and a status in the community, which you
ought to value more than you do. And your father begot you with
hand and foot, but should either of them mortify, you pay the
surgeon to cut it off. Thus Calypso clad and "dressed" Odysseus "in
raiment smelling sweet,"<a name="FNanchor_891_891" id=
"FNanchor_891_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891_891" class=
"fnanchor">891</a> like the body of an immortal, as a gift and
token of her affection for him; but when his vessel was upset and
he himself immersed, and owing to this wet and heavy raiment could
hardly keep himself on the top of the waves, he threw it off and
stripped himself, and covered his naked breast with Ino's veil,<a
name="FNanchor_892_892" id="FNanchor_892_892"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_892_892" class="fnanchor">892</a> and "swam for it

"FNanchor_893_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893_893" class=
"fnanchor">893</a> and so saved his life, and lacked neither food
nor raiment. What then? have not poor debtors storms, when the
money-lender stands over them and says, <i>Pay</i>?</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>Thus interest rolls on interest as wave upon wave, and he that
is involved in debt struggles against the load that bears him down,
but cannot swim away and escape, but sinks to the bottom, and
carries with him to ruin his friends that have gone security for
him. But Crates the Theban, though he had neither duns nor debts,
and was only disgusted at the distracting cares of housekeeping,
gave up a property worth eight talents, and assumed the
philosopher's threadbare cloak and wallet, and took refuge <span

philosophy and poverty. And Anaxagoras left his sheep-farm. But why
need I mention these? since the lyric poet Philoxenus, obtaining by
lot in a Sicilian colony much substance and a house abounding in
every kind of comfort, but finding that luxury and pleasure and
absence of refinement was the fashion there, said, "By the gods
these comforts shall not undo me, I will give them up," and he left
his lot to others, and sailed home again. But debtors have to put
up with being dunned, subjected to tribute, suffering slavery,
passing debased coin, and like Phineus, feeding certain winged
Harpies, who carry off and lay violent hands on their food, not at
the proper season, for they get possession of their debtors' corn
before it is sown, and they traffic for oil before the olives are
ripe; and the money-lender says, "I have wine at such and such a
price," and takes a bond for it, when the grapes are yet on the
vine waiting for Arcturus to ripen them.</p>

<h3>WHETHER "LIVE UNKNOWN" BE A WISE PRECEPT.<a name="Page_373a"

precept<a name="FNanchor_895_895" id="FNanchor_895_895"></a><a
href="#Footnote_895_895" class="fnanchor">895</a> certainly did not
wish to live unknown, for he uttered it to let all the world know
he was a superior thinker, and to get to himself unjust glory by
exhorting others to shun glory.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I hate the wise man for
himself not wise."<a name="FNanchor_896_896" id=

<p>They say that Philoxenus the son of Eryxis and Gnatho the
Sicilian, being exceedingly greedy where good fare was going, would
blow their nose in the dishes, to disgust all others at the table,
that they alone might take their fill of the choicest dishes. So
those that are insatiable pursuers of glory calumniate glory to
others who are their rivals, that they may get it without
antagonists. In this they <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374"
id="Page_374">374</a></span>resemble rowers, who face the stern of
the vessel but propel it ahead, that by the recoil from the stroke
of their oars they may reach port, so those that give vent to
precepts like this pursue glory with their face turned in the
opposite direction. For otherwise what need was there to utter a
precept like this, or to write and hand it down to posterity, if he
wished to live unknown to his own generation, who did not wish to
live unknown to posterity?</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> Look at the matter in the
following way.<a name="FNanchor_897_897" id=
"FNanchor_897_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897_897" class=
"fnanchor">897</a> Has not that "live unknown" a villainous ring,
as though one had broken open graves? Is your life so disgraceful
that we must all be ignorant of it? For my part I should say, Even
if your life be bad do not live unknown, but be known, reform,
repent; if you have virtue, be not utterly useless in life; if you
are vicious, do not continue unreformed. Point out then and define
to whom you recommend this precept. If to an ignorant or wicked or
senseless person, you resemble one who should say to a person in a
fever or delirium, "Be unknown. Don't let the doctor know your
condition. Go and throw yourself into some dark place, that you and
your ailments may be unknown." So you say to a vicious man, "Go off
with your vice, and hide your deadly and irremediable disease from
your friends, fearful to show your superstitious fears,
palpitations as it were, to those who could admonish you and cure
you." Our remote ancestors paid public attention to the sick, and
if any one had either had or cured a similar complaint, he
communicated his experience to the patient, and so they say medical
art became great by these contributions from experience. We ought
also in the same way to expose to everyone diseased lives and the
passions of the soul, and to handle them, and to examine the
condition of each,<a name="FNanchor_898_898" id=
"FNanchor_898_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898_898" class=
"fnanchor">898</a> and say, Are you a passionate man? Be on your
guard against anger. Are you of a jealous turn? Look to it. Are you
in love? I myself was in love once, but I had to repent. But
nowadays people deny and conceal and cloak their vices, and so fix
them deeper in themselves.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> Moreover if you advise
men of worth to live un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id=
"Page_375">375</a></span>known and in obscurity, you say to
Epaminondas, Do not be a general; and to Lycurgus, Do not be a
legislator; and to Thrasybulus, Do not be a tyrannicide; and to
Pythagoras, Do not teach; and to Socrates, Do not discourse; and
first and foremost you bid yourself, Epicurus, to refrain from
writing letters to your friends in Asia, and from enrolling
Egyptian strangers among your disciples, and from dancing
attendance on the youths of Lampsacus, and sending books to all
quarters to display your wisdom to all men and all women, and
leaving directions in your will about your funeral. What is the
meaning of those common tables of yours? what that crowd of friends
and handsome youths? Why those many thousand lines written and
composed so laboriously on Metrodorus, and Aristobulus, and
Ch&aelig;redemus, that they may not be unknown even in death, if<a
name="FNanchor_899_899" id="FNanchor_899_899"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_899_899" class="fnanchor">899</a> you ordain for virtue
oblivion, for art inactivity, for philosophy silence, and for
success that it should be speedily forgotten?</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> But if you exclude all
knowledge about life, like putting the lights out at a supper
party, that you may go from pleasure to pleasure undetected,<a
name="FNanchor_900_900" id="FNanchor_900_900"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_900_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> then "live unknown."
Certainly if I am going to pass my life with the harlot Hedeia, or
my days with Leontium, and spurn at virtue, and put my <i>summum
bonum</i> in sensual gratifications, these are ends that require
darkness and night, on these oblivion and ignorance are rightly
cast. But if any one in nature sings the praises of the deity and
justice and providence, and in morals upholds the law and society
and the constitution, and in the constitution what is honourable
and not expedient, why should he "live unknown"? Is it that he
should instruct nobody, inspire in nobody an emulation for virtue,
and be to nobody a pattern in good?<a name="FNanchor_901_901" id=
"FNanchor_901_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901_901" class=
"fnanchor">901</a> Had Themistocles been unknown at Athens, Greece
would not have repelled Xerxes; had Camillus been unknown at Rome,
Rome would not have remained a state; had Plato been unknown to
Dion, Sicily would not have won its freedom. And as light, I take
it, makes us not only visible <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>but useful to one another,
so knowledge gives not only glory but impetus to virtue.
Epaminondas in obscurity up to his fortieth year was no use to the
Thebans, but when his merits became known and he was put into
power, he saved his state from ruin, and liberated Greece from
slavery, making his abilities efficacious in emergency through his
reputation like the bright shining of a light. For Sophocles'
words,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Brightly shines brass in use,
but when unused</span> <span class="i0">It groweth dull in time,
and mars the house,"<a name="FNanchor_902_902" id=

</div>

<p>are also appropriate to the character of a man, which gets rusty
and senile by not mixing in affairs but living in obscurity. For
mute inglorious ease, and a sedentary life devoted to leisure, not
only injure the body but also the soul: and as hidden waters
overshadowed and stagnant get foul because they have no outlet, so
the innate powers of unruffled lives, that neither imbibe nor pass
on anything, even if they had any useful element in them once, seem
to be effete and wasted.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> Have you never noticed how
when night comes on a tired languor seizes the body, and inactive
torpor overpowers the soul, and reason shrinks within itself like a
fire going out, and feeling quite worn out is gently agitated by
disordered fancies, only just indicating that the man is alive? But
when the sun rises and scares away deceitful dreams, and brings on
as it were the everyday world<a name="FNanchor_903_903" id=
"FNanchor_903_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903_903" class=
"fnanchor">903</a> and with its light rouses and stimulates the
thoughts and actions of everybody, then, as Democritus says, "men
form new ideas for the day," and betake themselves to their various
pursuits with mutual impetuosity, as if drawn by a strong
impulse.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> And I think that life
itself, and the way we come into the world, is so ordained by the
deity that we should know one another. For everyone comes into this
great universe obscure and unknown casually and by degrees, but
when he mixes with his fellows and grows to maturity he shines
forth, and becomes well-known instead of obscure, <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>and
conspicuous instead of unknown. For knowledge is not the road to
being, as some say, but being to knowledge, for being does not
create but only exhibits things, as death is not the reducing of
existence to non-existence, but rather the result of dissolution is
obscurity. So people considering the Sun as Apollo according to
hereditary and ancient institutions, call him Delius<a name=
"FNanchor_904_904" id="FNanchor_904_904"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_904_904" class="fnanchor">904</a> and Pythius; whereas
the lord of the world of darkness, whether god or demon, they call
Hades<a name="FNanchor_905_905" id="FNanchor_905_905"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_905_905" class="fnanchor">905</a> (for when we die we go
into an unseen and invisible place), and the lord of dark night and
idle sleep. And I think our ancestors called man himself by a word
meaning light,<a name="FNanchor_906_906" id=
"FNanchor_906_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906_906" class=
"fnanchor">906</a> because by their relationship to light all have
implanted in them a strong and vehement desire to know and to be
known. And some philosophers think that the soul itself is light in
its essence, inferring so on other grounds and because it can least
endure ignorance about facts, and hates<a name="FNanchor_907_907"
id="FNanchor_907_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907_907" class=
"fnanchor">907</a> everything obscure, and is disturbed at
everything dark, which inspires fear and suspicion in it, whereas
light is so dear and welcome to it that it thinks nothing otherwise
delightful bearable without it, as indeed light makes every
pleasure pastime and enjoyment gay and cheerful, like the
application of some sweet and general flavour. But the man who
thrusts himself into obscurity, and wraps himself up in darkness
and buries himself alive, is like one who is dissatisfied with his
birth, and renounces his being.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> And yet <i>Pindar</i>
tells us<a name="FNanchor_908_908" id="FNanchor_908_908"></a><a
href="#Footnote_908_908" class="fnanchor">908</a> that the abode of
the blest is a glorious existence, where the sun shines bright
through the entire night in meadows red with roses, an extensive
plain full of shady trees ever in bloom never in fruit, watered by
gentle purling streams, and there the blest ones pass their time
away in thinking and talking about the past and present in social
converse....<a name="FNanchor_909_909" id="FNanchor_909_909"></a><a
href="#Footnote_909_909" class="fnanchor">909</a> But the third
road is of those who have lived unholy and lawless lives, that
thrusts their souls to Erebus and the bottomless pit, where
sluggish streams of murky night belch forth endless darkness, which
receive those that are to be punished <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>and conceal them in
forgetfulness and oblivion. For vultures do not always prey on the
liver of wicked persons lying on the ground,<a name=
"FNanchor_910_910" id="FNanchor_910_910"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_910_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> for it is destroyed by
fire or has rolled away; nor does the carrying of heavy burdens
press upon and tire out the bodies of those that undergo
punishment,</p>

<div class="poem">

<p>nor have the dead any vestige of body that can receive the
infliction of punishment that can make impression; but in reality
the only punishment of those who have lived ill is infamy and
obscurity and utter annihilation, which hurries them off to the
dark river of oblivion,<a name="FNanchor_912_912" id=

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> They say those discourses,
like friends, are best and surest that come to our refuge and aid
in adversity, and are useful. For many who come forward do more
harm than good in the remarks they make to the unfortunate, as
people unable to swim trying to rescue the drowning get entangled
with them and sink to the bottom together. Now the discourse that
ought to come from friends and people disposed to be helpful should
be consolation, and not mere assent with a man's sad feelings. For
we do not in adverse circumstances need people to weep and wail
with us like choruses in a tragedy, but people to speak plainly to
us and instruct us, that grief and dejection of mind are in all
cases useless and idle and senseless; and that where the
circumstances themselves, when examined by the light of reason,
enable a man to say to himself that his trouble is greater in fancy
than in reality, it is quite ridiculous not to inquire of the body
what it has suffered, nor of the mind if it is any the worse for
what has happened, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id=
"Page_379">379</a></span>but to employ external sympathizers to
teach us what our grief is.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> Therefore let us examine
alone by ourselves the weight of our misfortunes, as if they were
burdens. For the body is weighed down by the burden of what presses
on it, but the soul often adds to the real load a burden of its
own. A stone is naturally hard, and ice naturally cold, but they do
not receive these properties and impressions from without; whereas
with regard to exile and loss of reputation or honours, as also
with regard to their opposites, as crowns and office and position,
it is not their own intrinsic nature but our opinion of them that
is the gauge of their real joy or sorrow, so that each person makes
them for himself light or heavy, easy to bear or hard to bear. When
Polynices was asked</p>

<p>Compare with this the language of Alcman, as the poet has
represented him in the following lines. "Sardis, my father's
ancient home, had I had the fortune to be reared in thee, I should
have been dressed in gold as a priest of Cybele,<a name=
"FNanchor_914_914" id="FNanchor_914_914"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_914_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> and beaten the fine
drums; but as it is my name is Alcman, and I am a citizen of
Sparta, and I have learned to write Greek poetry, which makes me
greater than the tyrants Dascyles or Gyges." Thus the very same
thing one man's opinion makes good, like current coin, and
another's bad and injurious.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> But let it be granted
that exile is, as many say and sing, a grievous thing. So some food
is bitter, and sharp, and biting to the taste, yet by an admixture
with it of sweet and agreeable food we take away its
unpleasantness. There are also some colours unpleasant to look at,
that quite confuse and dazzle us by their intensity and excessive
force. If then we can relieve this by a mixture of shadow, or by
diverting the eye to green or some agreeable colour, so too can we
deal with misfortunes, mixing up <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>with them the advantages and
pleasant things we still enjoy, as wealth, or friends, or leisure,
and no deficiency in what is necessary for our subsistence. For I
do not think that there are many natives of Sardis who would not
choose your fortune even with exile, and be content to live as you
do in a strange land, rather than, like snails who have no other
home than their shells, enjoy no other blessing but staying at home
in ease.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> As then he in the comedy
that was exhorting an unfortunate friend to take courage and bear
up against fortune, when he asked him "how," answered "as a
philosopher," so may we also play the philosopher's part and bear
up against fortune manfully. How do we do when it rains, or when
the North Wind doth blow? We go to the fire, or the baths, or the
house, or put on another coat: we don't sit down in the rain and
cry. So too can you more than most revive and cheer yourself for
the chill of adversity, not standing in need of outward aid, but
sensibly using your actual advantages. The surgeon's
cupping-glasses extract the worst humours from the body to relieve
and preserve the rest of it, whereas the melancholy and querulous
by ever dwelling on their worst circumstances, and thinking only of
them, and being engrossed by their troubles, make even useful
things useless to them, at the very time when the need is most
urgent. For as to those two jars, my friend, that Homer<a name=
"FNanchor_915_915" id="FNanchor_915_915"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_915_915" class="fnanchor">915</a> says are stored in
Heaven, one full of good fortunes, one of bad, it is not Zeus that
presides as the dispenser of them, giving to some a gentle and even
portion, and to others unmixed streams of evils, but ourselves. For
the sensible make their life pleasanter and more endurable by
mitigating their sorrows with the consideration of their blessings,
while most people, like sieves, let the worst things stick to them
while the best pass through.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> And so, if we fall into any
real trouble or evil, we ought to get cheerfulness and ease of mind
from the consideration of the actual blessings that are still left
to us, mitigating outward trouble by private happiness. And as to
those things which are not really evil in their nature, <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>but
only so from imagination and empty fancy, we must act as we do with
children who are afraid of masks: by bringing them near, and
putting them in their hands, and turning them about, we accustom
them never to heed them at all: and so we by bringing reason to
bear on it may discover the rottenness and emptiness and
exaggeration of our fancy. As a case in point let us take your
present exile from what you deem your country. For in nature no
country, or house, or field, or smithy, as Aristo said, or surgery,
is peculiarly ours, but all such things exist or rather take their
name in connection with the person who dwells in them or possesses
them. For man, as Plato says, is not an earthly and immovable but
heavenly plant, the head making the body erect as from a root, and
turned up to heaven.<a name="FNanchor_916_916" id=

<p>These are the boundaries of our country, nor is there either
exile or stranger or foreigner in these, where there is the same
fire, water and air, the same rulers controllers and presidents,
the sun the moon and the morning star, the same laws to all, under
one appointment and ordinance the summer and winter solstices, the
equinoxes, Pleias and Arcturus, the seasons of sowing and planting;
where there is one king and ruler, God, who has under his
jurisdiction the beginning and middle and end of everything, and
travels round and does everything in a regular way in accordance
with nature; and in his wake to punish all transgressions of the
divine law follows Justice, whom <span class='pagenum'><a name=

Sardis, that is nothing. Neither do all the Athenians dwell at
Colyttus, nor all the Corinthians at Craneum, nor all the
Laced&aelig;monians at Pitane. Do you consider all those Athenians
strangers and exiles who removed from Melita to Diomea, where they
call the month Metageitnion,<a name="FNanchor_917_917" id=
"FNanchor_917_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917_917" class=
"fnanchor">917</a> and keep the festival Metageitnia to commemorate
their migration, and gladly and gaily accept and are content with
their neighbourhood with other people? Surely you would not. What
part of the inhabited world or of the whole earth is very far
distant from another part, seeing that mathematicians teach us that
the whole earth is a mere point compared to heaven? But we, like
ants or bees, if we get banished from one ant-hill or hive are in
sore distress and feel lost, not knowing or having learnt to make
and consider all things our own, as indeed they are. And yet we
laugh at the stupidity of one who asserts that the moon shines
brighter at Athens than at Corinth, though in a sort we are in the
same case ourselves, when in a strange land we look on the earth,
the sea, the air, the sky, as if we doubted whether or not they
were different from those we had been accustomed to. For nature
makes us free and unrestrained, but we bind and confine immure and
force ourselves into small and scanty space. Then too we laugh at
the Persian kings, who, if the story be true, drink only of the
water of the Choaspes, thus making the rest of the world waterless
as far as they are concerned, but when we migrate to other places,
we desire the water of the Cephisus, or we yearn for the Eurotas,
or Taygetus, or Parnassus, and so make the whole world for
ourselves houseless and homeless.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vii.</span> Some Egyptians, who
migrated to Ethiopia because of the anger and wrath of their king,
to those who begged them to return to their wives and children very
immodestly exposed their persons, saying that they would never be
in want of wives or children while so provided. It is far more
becoming and less low to say that whoever <span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>has the good fortune to
be provided with the few necessaries of life is nowhere a stranger,
nowhere without home and hearth, only he must have besides these
prudence and sense, as an anchor and helm, that he may be able to
moor himself in any harbour. For a person indeed who has lost his
wealth it is not easy quickly to get another fortune, but every
city is at once his country to the man who knows how to make it
such, and has the roots by which he can live and thrive and get
acclimatized in every place, as was the case with Themistocles and
Demetrius of Phalerum. The latter after his banishment became a
great friend of Ptolemy at Alexandria, and not only passed his days
in abundance, but also sent gifts to the Athenians. And
Themistocles, who was publicly entertained at the king's expense,
is stated to have said to his wife and children, "We should have
been ruined, if we had not been ruined." And so Diogenes the Cynic
to the person who said to him, "The people of Sinope have condemned
you to banishment from Pontus," replied, "And I have condemned them
to stay in Pontus, 'by the high cliffs of the inhospitable sea.'"<a

"#Footnote_918_918" class="fnanchor">918</a>[918] And Stratonicus
asked his host at Seriphus, for what offence exile was the
appointed punishment, and being told that they punished rogues by
exile, said, "Why then are not you a rogue, to escape from this
hole of a place?" For the comic poet says they get their crop of
figs down there with slings, and that the island is very barely
supplied with the necessaries of life.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">viii.</span> For if you look at the
real facts and shun idle fancy, he that has one city is a stranger
and foreigner in all others. For it does not seem to such a one
fair and just to leave his own city and dwell in another. "It has
been your lot to be a citizen of Sparta, see that you adorn your
native city," whether it be inglorious, or unhealthy, or disturbed
with factions, or has its affairs in disorder. But the person whom
fortune has deprived of his own city, she allows to make his home
in any he fancies. That was an excellent precept of Pythagoras,
"Choose the best kind of life, custom will make it easy." So too it
is wise and profitable to say here, "Choose the best and
pleasantest <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id=
"Page_384">384</a></span>city, time will make it your country, and
a country that will not always distract you and trouble you and
give you various orders such as, 'Contribute so much money, Go on
an embassy to Rome, Entertain the prefect, Perform public duties.'"
If a person in his senses and not altogether silly were to think of
these things, he would prefer to live in exile in some island, like
Gryarus or Cinarus,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Savage, and fruitless, ill

Naxos, or at any rate Hyria, which is close here. But the former
was the home of Ephialtes and Otus, and the latter was the
dwelling-place of Orion. And Alcm&aelig;on, when fleeing from the
Furies, so the poets tell us, dwelt in a place recently formed by
the silting of the Achelous;<a name="FNanchor_919_919" id=

in ease and quiet, merely to avoid political disturbances and
factions, and those furies informers. And the Emperor Tiberius
lived the last seven years of his life in the island of
Capre&aelig;, and the sacred governing power of the world enclosed
in his breast during all that time never changed its abode. But the
incessant and constant cares of empire, coming from all sides, made
not that island repose of his pure and complete. But he who can
disembark on a small island, and get rid of great troubles, is a
miserable man, if he cannot often say and sing to himself those
lines of Pindar, "To love the slender cypress, and to leave the
Cretan pastures lying near Ida. I have but little land, where I
grow strong, and have nothing to do with sorrow or faction,"<a

much less should we measure happiness by ropes and parasangs, and
if we inhabit an island containing 200 furlongs only, and not (like
Sicily) four days' sail round, ought we to wail and lament as if we
were very unfortunate? For how does plenty of room bring about an
easy life? Have you not heard Tantalus saying in the play,<a name=

only ship he had left was with all its freight lost at sea, he
said, "Fortune, you deal kindly with me, confining me to my
threadbare cloak and the life of a philosopher." And a man not
altogether silly, or madly in love with crowds, might, I think, not
blame fortune for confining him in an island, but might even praise
her for relieving him from weariness and anxiety, and wanderings in
foreign countries, and perils by sea, and the uproar of the forum,
and for giving him truly a secure, quiet, undistracted and private
life, putting him as it were inside a circle in which everything
necessary for him was contained. For what island has not a house, a
promenade, a bath, and fish and hares for those who love fishing
and field-sports? And the greatest blessing, quiet, which others
frequently pant for, you can freely enjoy.<a name=

drag them by force to the forum and court, in an island no one
comes to bother one or dun one or to borrow money, or to beg one to
be surety for him or canvass for him: only one's best friends and
intimates come to visit one out of good will and affection, and the
rest of one's life is a sort of holy retirement to whoever wishes
or has learnt to live the life of leisure. But he who thinks those
happy who are always scouring the country, and pass most of their
lives in inns and ferryboats, is like a person who thinks the
planets happier than fixed stars. And yet every planet keeps its
order, rolling in one sphere, as in an island. For, as Heraclitus

<p>so we, fixing our eyes only on one aspect of exile, its
inglorious state, overlook its freedom from cares, its leisure, its
liberty. And yet people thought the kings of Persia happy, because
they passed their winter in Babylon, their summer in Media, and the
pleasant season of spring at Susa. So can the exile be present at
the Eleusinian mysteries, at the festival of Dionysus at Athens, at
the Nemean <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id=

Delphi, and can pass on and be a spectator of the Isthmian and
Corinthian games, if he is fond of sight-seeing; and if not, he has
leisure, can walk about, read, sleep without being disturbed, and
can say like Diogenes, "Aristotle has to dine when Philip thinks

changed the commencing words of Herodotus, "This is the setting
forth of the history of Herodotus of Halicarnassus" into "Herodotus
of Thurii." For he migrated to Thurii, and participated in that
colony. As to the divine and sacred spirit of the Muses, the poet
of the Trojan war, Homer, did not many cities claim him as theirs,
because he did not cry up one city only? And Hospitable Zeus has
many great honours.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id=

if anyone shall say that these pursued glory and honour, go to the
philosophers, and their schools and lectures, consider those at the
Lyceum, the Academy, the Porch, the Palladium, the Odeum. If you
admire and prefer the Peripatetic school, Aristotle was a native of
Stagira, Theophrastus of Eresus, Strato of Lampsacus, Glyco of
Troas, Aristo of Ceos, Critolaus of Phaselis. If you prefer the
Stoic school, Zeno was a native of Cittium, Cleanthes of Assus,
Chrysippus of Soli, Diogenes of Babylon, Antipater of Tarsus; and
the Athenian Archidemus migrated to the country of the Parthians,
and left at Babylon a succession of the Stoic school. Who exiled
these men? Nobody; it was their own pursuit of quiet, of which no
one who is famous or powerful can get much at home, that made them
teach us this by their practice, while they taught us other things
by their precepts. And even nowadays most excellent and renowned
persons live in strange lands, not in consequence of being expelled
or banished, but at their own option, to avoid business and
distracting cares, and the want of leisure which their own country
would bring them. For it seems to me that the Muses aided our old
writers to complete their finest and most esteemed works by calling
in exile as a fellow-worker. Thus Thucydides the Athenian wrote the
history of the war between the Peloponnesians and the Athenians in
Thrace near the forest of Scapte, Xenophon wrote at Scillus in
Elis, Philistus in Epirus, Tim&aelig;us of Tauromenium at Athens,
Androtion of Athens at Megara, and Bacchylides the poet<a name=
"FNanchor_933_933" id="FNanchor_933_933"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_933_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> in Peloponnesus. All
these and many more, though exiled from their country, did not
despair or give themselves up to dejection, but so happy was their
disposition that they considered exile a resource given them by
fortune, whereby they obtained universal fame after their deaths,
whereas no memorial is left of those who were factious against them
and banished them.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xv.</span> He therefore is ridiculous
who thinks that any ignominy attaches itself to exile. What say
you? Was Diogenes without glory, whom Alexander saw basking in the
sun, and stopped to ask if he wanted anything, and when he <span
class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id=

a little out of my light," Alexander, astonished at his spirit,
said to his friends, "If I were not Alexander, I would be
Diogenes." Was Camillus without glory when banished from Rome, of
which he is now accounted the second founder? And indeed
Themistocles did not lose by his exile the glory he had obtained
among the Greeks, but he added to it among the barbarians, and
there is no one so without honour, so ignoble, who would prefer to
be Leobates who indicted him rather than Themistocles the exile, or
Clodius who banished Cicero rather than the banished one, or
Aristophon the accuser rather than Timotheus who got driven by him
from his country.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvi.</span> But since a good many are
moved by the lines of Euripides, who seems to bring a strong
indictment against exile, let us see what it is he says in each
question and answer about it.</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0"><i>Jocasta.</i> What is't to
be an exile? Is it grievous?</span> <span class=
"i0"><i>Polynices.</i> Most grievous, and in deed worse than in
word.</span> <span class="i0"><i>Jocasta.</i> What is its aspect?
What is hard for exiles?</span> <span class="i0"><i>Polynices.</i>
This is the greatest, that they have no freedom.</span> <span
class="i0"><i>Jocasta.</i> This is a slave's life not to speak
one's thoughts!</span> <span class="i0"><i>Polynices.</i> Then one
must put up with one's masters' follies.<a name="FNanchor_934_934"
id="FNanchor_934_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934_934" class=
"fnanchor">934</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>But this is not a right or true estimate.<a name=
"FNanchor_935_935" id="FNanchor_935_935"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_935_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> For first of all, not
to say out all one thinks is not the action of a slave but of a
sensible man, in times and matters that require reticence and
silence, as Euripides himself has said elsewhere better,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i2">"Be silent where 'tis meet,
speak where 'tis safe."</span></div>
</div>

<p>Then as for the follies of one's masters, one has to put up with
them just as much in one's own country as in exile. Indeed, more
frequently have the former reason to fear that the powerful in
cities will act unjustly to them either through calumny or
violence. But his greatest and absurdest error is that he takes
away from exiles freedom of speech. It is wonderful, if Theodorus
had no freedom of speech, that when Lysimachus the king said to
him, "Did <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id=
"Page_391">391</a></span>not your country cast you out because of
your character?" replied, "Yes, as Semele cast out Dionysus, when
unable to bear him any longer." And when he showed him Telesphorus
in a cage,<a name="FNanchor_936_936" id="FNanchor_936_936"></a><a
href="#Footnote_936_936" class="fnanchor">936</a> with his eyes
scooped out, and his nose and ears and tongue cut off, and said to
him, "This is how I treat those that act ill to me." * *<a name=
"FNanchor_937_937" id="FNanchor_937_937"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_937_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> And had not Diogenes
freedom of speech, who, when he visited Philip's camp just as he
was on the eve of offering battle to the Greeks, and was taken
before the king as a spy, told him he had come to see his
insatiable folly, who was going shortly to stake his dominions and
life on a mere die. And did not Hannibal the Carthaginian use
freedom of speech to Antiochus, though he was an exile, and
Antiochus a king? For as a favourable occasion presented itself he
urged the king to attack the enemy, and when after sacrifice he
reported that the entrails forbade it, Hannibal chided him and
said, "You listen rather to what flesh tells you than to the
instruction of a man of experience." Nor does exile deprive
geometricians or grammarians of their freedom of speech, or prevent
their discussing what they know and have learnt. Why should it then
good and worthy men? It is meanness everywhere that stops a man's
speech, ties and gags his tongue, and forces him to be silent. But
what are the next lines of Euripides?</p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0"><i>Jocasta.</i> Hopes feed the
hearts of exiles, so they say.</span> <span class=
"i0"><i>Polynices.</i> Hopes have a flattering smile, but still
delay.<a name="FNanchor_938_938" id="FNanchor_938_938"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_938_938" class="fnanchor">938</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>But this is an accusation against folly rather than exile. For
it is not those who have learnt and know how to enjoy the present,
but those who ever hang on the future, and hope after what they
have not, that float as it were on hope as on a raft, though they
never get beyond the walls.<a name="FNanchor_939_939" id=
"FNanchor_939_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939_939" class=
"fnanchor">939</a></p>

<div class="poem2">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0"><i>Jocasta.</i> But did your
father's friends do nothing for you?</span> <span class=
"i0"><i>Polynices.</i> Be fortunate! Friends are no use in
trouble.</span> <span class="i0"><i>Jocasta.</i> Did not your good
birth better your condition?</span> <span class=
"i0"><i>Polynices.</i> 'Tis bad to want. Birth brought no bread to

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id=
"Page_392">392</a></span> But it was ungrateful in Polynices thus
to rail against exile as discrediting his good birth and robbing
him of friends, for it was on account of his good birth that he was
deemed worthy of a royal bride though an exile, and he came to
fight supported by a band of friends and allies, a great force, as
he himself admits a little later,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i2">"Many of the princes of the
Danai</span> <span class="i0">And from Mycen&aelig; are with me,

"#Footnote_941_941" class="fnanchor">941</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>Nor was there any more justice in the lament of his
mother:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"I never lit for you the
nuptial torch</span> <span class="i0">In marriage customary, nor
did Ismenus</span> <span class="i0">Furnish you with the usual

<p>She ought to have been pleased and content to hear that her son
dwelt in such a palace <i>as that at Argos</i>, and in lamenting
that the nuptial torch was not lit, and that he had not had the
usual bath in the river Ismenus, as though there was no water or
fire at Argos for wedded people, she lays on exile the evils really
caused by pride and stupidity.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">xvii.</span> But exile, you will say,
is a matter of reproach. It may be among fools, who also jeer at
the beggar, the bald man, the dwarf, aye, and even the stranger and
resident alien. But those who are not carried away in that manner
admire good men, whether they are poor, or strangers or exiles. Do
we not see that all men adore the temple of Theseus as well as the
Parthenon and Eleusinium? And yet Theseus was an exile from Athens,
though it was owing to him that Athens is now inhabited, and he was
banished from a city which he did not merely dwell in, but had
himself built. And what glory is left to Eleusis, if we are ashamed
of Eumolpus, who migrated from Thrace, and taught the Greeks (as he
still teaches them) the mysteries? And who was the father of Codrus
that reigned at Athens? Was it not Melanthus, an exile from
Messene? And do you not praise the answer of Antisthenes to the
person who told him that his mother was a Phrygian, "So also is the
mother of the gods." If you <span class='pagenum'><a name=
"Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>are twitted then with exile,
why do you not answer, "The father of the glorious victor Hercules
was an exile." And Cadmus, the grandfather of Dionysus, when he was
sent from home to find Europa, and never came back, "though a
Ph&oelig;nician born he changed his country,"<a name=
"FNanchor_943_943" id="FNanchor_943_943"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_943_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> and migrated to
Thebes, and became<a name="FNanchor_944_944" id=
"FNanchor_944_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944_944" class=
"fnanchor">944</a> the grandfather of "Dionysus, who rejoices in
the cry of Evoe, the exciter of women, who delights in frantic
honours." As for what &AElig;schylus obscurely hints at in the
line,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Apollo the chaste god, exile
from heaven,"</span></div>
</div>

<p>let me keep a religious silence, as Herodotus<a name=
"FNanchor_945_945" id="FNanchor_945_945"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_945_945" class="fnanchor">945</a> says. And Empedocles
commences his system of philosophy as follows, "It is an ordinance
of necessity, an ancient decree of the gods, when anyone stains his
hands with crime and murder, the long-lived demons get hold of him,
so that he wanders away from the gods for thirty thousand years.
Such is my condition now, that of an exile and wanderer from the
gods." In these words he not only speaks of himself, but points out
that all of us men similarly are strangers and foreigners and
exiles in this world. For he says, "O men, it is not blood or a
compounded spirit that made the being or beginning of the soul, but
it is your earth-born and mortal body that is made up of these." He
calls speciously by the mildest of names the birth of the soul that
has come from elsewhere a living in a strange country. But the
truth is the soul is an exile and wanderer, being driven about by
the divine decrees and laws, and then, as in some sea-girt island,
gets joined to the body like an oyster to its shell, as Plato says,
because it cannot call to mind or remember from what honour and
greatness of happiness it migrated, not from Sardis to Athens, nor
from Corinth to Lemnos or Scyros, but exchanging heaven and the
moon for earth and life upon earth, if it shifts from place to
place for ever so short a time it is put out and feels strange, and
fades away like a dying plant. But although one soil is more
suitable to a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id=
"Page_394">394</a></span>plant than another, and it thrives and
grows better on such a soil, yet no situation can rob a man of his
happiness or virtue or sense. It was in prison that Anaxagoras
wrote his squaring of the circle, and that Socrates, even after
drinking the hemlock, talked philosophically, and begged his
friends to be philosophers, and was esteemed happy by them. On the
other hand, Pha&euml;thon and Tantalus, though they got up to
heaven, fell into the greatest misfortunes through their folly, as
the poets tell us.</p>

<h3><a name="Page_394a" id="Page_394a" />ON FORTUNE.</h3>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">i.</span> "Fortune, not wisdom, rules
the affairs of mortals."<a name="FNanchor_946_946" id=
"FNanchor_946_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946_946" class=
"fnanchor">946</a> And does not justice, and fairness, and
sobriety, and decorum rule the affairs of mortals? Was it of
fortune or owing to fortune that Aristides persevered in his
poverty, when he might have been lord of much wealth? And that
Scipio after taking Carthage neither saw nor received any of the
spoil? Was it of fortune or owing to fortune that Philocrates spent
on harlots and fish the money he had received from Philip? And that
Lasthenes and Euthycrates lost Olynthus, measuring happiness by
their belly and lusts? Was it of fortune that Alexander the son of
Philip not only himself abstained from the captive women, but
punished others that outraged them? Was it under the influence of
an evil genius and fortune that Alexander,<a name=
"FNanchor_947_947" id="FNanchor_947_947"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_947_947" class="fnanchor">947</a> the son of Priam,
intrigued with the wife of his host and ran away with her, and
filled two continents with war and evils? For if all these things
are due to fortune, what hinders our saying that cats and goats and
apes are under the influence of fortune in respect of greediness,
and lust, and ribaldry?</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">ii.</span> And if there are such
things as sobriety and justice and fortitude, with what reason can
we deny the existence of prudence, and if prudence exists, how can
we deny the existence of wisdom? For sobriety is a kind of
prudence, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id=
"Page_395">395</a></span>as people say, and justice also needs the
presence of prudence. Nay more, we call the wisdom and prudence
that makes people good in regard to pleasure self-control and
sobriety, and in dangers and hardships endurance and fortitude, and
in dealings between man and man and in public life equity and
justice. And so, if we are to ascribe to fortune the acts of
wisdom, let us ascribe justice and sobriety to fortune also, aye,
and let us put down to fortune stealing, and picking pockets, and
lewdness, and let us bid farewell to argument, and throw ourselves
entirely on fortune, as if we were, like dust or refuse, borne
along and hurried away by a violent wind. For if there be no
wisdom, it is not likely that there is any deliberation or
investigation of matters, or search for expediency, but Sophocles
only talked nonsense when he said,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"Whate'er is sought is found,
what is neglected</span> <span class="i0">Escapes our notice;"<a
name="FNanchor_948_948" id="FNanchor_948_948"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_948_948" class="fnanchor">948</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>and again in dividing human affairs,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"What can be taught I learn,
what can be found out</span> <span class="i0">Duly investigate, and
of the gods</span> <span class="i0">I ask for what is to be got by

href="#Footnote_949_949" class="fnanchor">949</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>For what can be found out or learnt by men, if everything is due
to fortune? And what deliberative assembly of a state is not
annulled, what council of a king is not abrogated, if all things
are subject to fortune? whom we abuse as blind because we ourselves
are blind in our dealings with her. Indeed, how can it be
otherwise, seeing that we repudiate wisdom, which is like plucking
out our eyes, and take a blind guide of our lives?</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iii.</span> Supposing any of us were
to assert that seeing is a matter of fortune, not of eyesight, nor
of the eyes that give light, as Plato says, and that hearing is a
matter of fortune, and not the imbibing of a current of air through
the ear and brain, it would be well for us then to be on our guard
against the evidence of our senses. But indeed <span class=
'pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>nature has
given us sight and hearing and taste and smell, and all other parts
of the body and their functions, as ministers of wisdom and
prudence. For "it is the mind that sees, and the mind that hears,
everything else is deaf and blind." And just as, if there were no
sun, we should have perpetual night for all the stars, as
Heraclitus says, so man for all his senses, if he had no mind or
reason, would be little better than the beasts. But as it is, it is
not by fortune or chance that we are superior to them and masters
of them, but Prometheus, that is reason, is the cause of this,</p>

<p>as &AElig;schylus says.<a name="FNanchor_950_950" id=
"FNanchor_950_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950_950" class=
"fnanchor">950</a> For as to fortune and natural condition, most of
the beasts are better off than we are. For some are armed with
horns and tusks and stings, and as for the hedgehog, as Empedocles
says, it has its back all rough with sharp bristles, and some are
shod and protected by scales and fur and talons and hoofs worn
smooth by use, whereas man alone, as Plato says, is left by nature
naked, unarmed, unshod, and uncovered. But by one gift, that of
reason and painstaking and forethought, nature compensates for all
these deficiencies. "Small indeed is the strength of man, but by
the versatility of his intellect he can tame the inhabitants of the
sea, earth, and air."<a name="FNanchor_951_951" id=
"FNanchor_951_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951_951" class=
"fnanchor">951</a> Nothing is more agile and swift than horses, yet
they run for man; the dog is a courageous and high-spirited
creature, yet it guards man; fish is most pleasant to the taste,
the pig the fattest of all animals, yet both are food and
delicacies for man. What is huger or more formidable in appearance
than the elephant? Yet it is man's plaything, and a spectacle at
public shows, and learns to dance and kneel. And all these things
are not idly introduced, but to the end that they may teach us to
what heights reason raises man, and what things it sets him above,
and how it makes him master of everything.</p>

<p>for in all these points we are less fortunate than the beasts.
But by our experience and memory and wisdom and cunning, as
Anaxagoras says, we make use of them, and get their honey and milk,
and catch them, and drive and lead them about at our will. And
there is nothing of fortune in this, it is all the result of wisdom
and forethought.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">iv.</span> Moreover the labours of
carpenters and coppersmiths and house-builders and statue-makers
are affairs of mortals, and we see that no success in such trades
is got by fortune or chance. For that fortune plays a very small
part in the life of a wise man, whether coppersmith or
house-builder, and that the greatest works are wrought by art
alone, is shown by the poet in the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza"><span class="i0">"All handicraftsmen go into
the street,</span> <span class="i0">Ye that with fan-shaped baskets
worship Ergane,</span> <span class="i0">Zeus' fierce-eyed
daughter;"<a name="FNanchor_953_953" id="FNanchor_953_953"></a><a
href="#Footnote_953_953" class="fnanchor">953</a></span></div>
</div>

<p>for Ergane<a name="FNanchor_954_954" id=
"FNanchor_954_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954_954" class=
"fnanchor">954</a> and Athene, and not Fortune, do the trades
regard as their patrons. They do indeed say that Nealces,<a name=
"FNanchor_955_955" id="FNanchor_955_955"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_955_955" class="fnanchor">955</a> on one occasion
painting a horse, was quite satisfied with his painting in all
other respects, but that some foam on the bridle from the horse's
breath did not please him, so that he frequently tried to rub it
out; at last in his anger he threw his sponge (just as it was, full
of colours) at the picture, and this very wonderfully produced
exactly the effect he desired. This is the only fortunate accident
in art that history records. Artificers everywhere use rules and
weights and measures, that none of their work may be done at random
and anyhow. And indeed the arts may be considered as wisdom on a
small scale, or rather as emanations from and fragments of wisdom
scattered about among the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398"
id="Page_398">398</a></span>necessities of life; as the fire of
Prometheus is riddled to have been divided and scattered about in
all quarters of the world. For thus small particles and fragments
of wisdom, breaking up as it were and getting divided into pieces,
have formed into order.</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">v.</span> It is strange then that the
arts do not require fortune to attain to their ends, and yet that
the most important and complete of all the arts, the sum total of
man's glory and merit, should be so completely powerless. Why,
there is a kind of wisdom even in the tightening or slackening of
chords, which people call music, and in the dressing of food, which
we call the art of cooking, and in cleaning clothes, which we call
the art of the fuller, and we teach boys how to put on their shoes
and clothes generally, and to take their meat in the right hand and
their bread in the left, since none of these things come by
fortune, but require attention and care. And are we to suppose that
the most important things which make so much for happiness do not
call for wisdom, and have nothing to do with reason and
forethought? Why, no one ever yet wetted earth with water and then
left it, thinking it would become bricks by fortune and
spontaneously, or procured wool and leather, and sat down and
prayed Fortune that it might become clothes and shoes; nor does
anyone getting together much gold and silver and a quantity of
slaves, and living in a spacious hall with many doors, and making a
display of costly couches and tables, believe that these things
will constitute his happiness, and give him a painless happy life
secure from changes, unless he be wise also. A certain person asked
the general Iphicrates in a scolding way who he was, as he seemed
neither a heavy-armed soldier, nor a bowman, nor a targeteer, and
he replied, "I am the person who rule and make use of all
these."</p>

<p>&sect; <span class="smcap">vi.</span> So wisdom is neither gold,
nor silver, nor fame, nor wealth, nor health, nor strength, nor
beauty. What is it then? It is what can use all these well, and
that by means of which each of these things becomes pleasant and
esteemed and useful, and without which they are useless; and
unprofitable and injurious, and a burden and disgrace to their
possessor. So Hesiod's Prometheus gives very good advice to
Epimetheus, "not to receive gifts from<span class='pagenum'><a
name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span> Olympian Zeus but to
send them back,"<a name="FNanchor_956_956" id=
"FNanchor_956_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956_956" class=
"fnanchor">956</a> meaning external things and things of fortune.
For as if he urged one who knew nothing of music not to play on the
pipe, or one who knew nothing of letters not to read, or one who
was not used to horses not to ride, so he advised him not to take
office if he were foolish, nor to grow rich if he were illiberal,
nor to marry if likely to be ruled by his wife. For success beyond
their merit is to foolish persons a cause of folly, as Demosthenes
said,<a name="FNanchor_957_957" id="FNanchor_957_957"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_957_957" class="fnanchor">957</a> and good fortune
beyond their merit is to those who are not sensible a cause of
misfortune.<a name="FNanchor_958_958" id="FNanchor_958_958"></a><a
